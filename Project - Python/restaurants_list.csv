Their selection of brunches is different than most other places. The one I usually go for includes a hot drink, a soup, a gratin dauphinois, two eggs Benedict, and a chocolate mousse. All of the items are excellent, especially the gratin dauphinois. This meal is usually very satisfying and cost less than $20 which is reasonable for good brunches in Montreal. The interior is very cute and feels homie and the service is usually good.",images/stars-5.png

This was my third time visiting this establishment. Unfortunately we had a poor dining experience, especially in terms of service. We ordered a Quebecois brunch platter to share for around $17.50. This included a cup of tea/espresso. The caramelized sausages were delicous however the poached eggs were not seasoned. The pancakes were not very good either and I believe our syrup was not maple syrup, which was a disappointment. Their hot chocolate is delicious, especially The Dalmatian, but a little on the pricey side at $5 a cup (but oh so light and frothy). The service was nothing short of disappointing. If you value service, don't bother coming here. We were meandering around waiting to be assigned a table until I finally asked if we were able to sit anywhere. We then had to ask for our menus as well as place our orders. Ultimately our experience was very lackluster and I will not be returning, no matter how much I love their hot chocolate.",images/stars-1.png

Today, I have found my favorite hot chocolate spot tucked away in the Latin Quarter of Montreal. I went with the classic Babette hot chocolate from the menu and came close to fainting after the first sip. In fact, I was so overwhelmed by all the happiness going on in my taste bud world, I danced to the counter and in chocolate drunkeness asked the owner to marry me. Ok, no I didn't.

I DID see them the day after I wrote my initial review, and the day after that, and the day after that, and the day after that.... And I love them. The food is delicious. They switch to a ""late night"" menu after around 9pm, when the grills get turned off, but even everything on there is delicious. I've had everything from the pizza to the Grown up Mac & Cheese, and its fantastic. The beers are local and domestic. You could pick a beer off the tap lineup, or grab a PBR or High Life. Keeping it classy. Football is big, if there's a game on (especially panthers) then a seat may be hard to find. Come early. The bartenders are fantastic and friendly, remember your name and your drink. One of my favorite things about this bar is the regulars, and not just because I am one. Every time I come in here they have some charity event coming up - whether its collecting blankets for the local dog shelter, or raising money for Isabella Santos Foundation (shameless plug), BV is helping, connecting people and bringing the community together. I love it. This year alone, they've raised over $2000 for the Isabella Santos Foundation, and over $7000 at their local charity golf tournament for Making Strides. I love this bar.

The bread/crust was fluffy yet crispy and cooked perfectly. The waitress even told us to take a picture before we started eating because it was so perfect. I had mushrooms, black olives and green peppers in mine and my husband had pepperoni and meatballs in his. We both LOVED them and will certainly go back for them again!

I try to eat healthy (most times) so I had a gluten free spicy chicken wrap. What I really wanted was the Belly Buster sandwich. A monster of a sandwich. It is 8 inches of garlic bread with meatballs,sausage,pepperoni, cheese, banana peppers and mozzarella sticks. They also have a challenge for their 16 inch version. No one has accomplished this feat as of yet. The wife had the chicken cordon bleu wrap with fresh garlic Parmesan potato chips. I can see why my wife's family keeps coming back.

It was just so unremarkable on every level that I can't see myself becoming even a fan. First off, we showed up at dinnertime and there were maybe 3 tables with people sitting at them. A family, some friends raucously laughing in the bar area, and some other crew. We had heard this place was worth trying, and it's quite close to where we live, so we thought, ""why not?"" We are kind of pretzel snobs, so we immediately asked if the pretzel appetizer consisted of house-made pretzels. Negative. One star removed just for that. With so many establishments in the area hoofing it to make their own pretzels, and this place already has some baking happening (pizza), I expected better. We skipped apps and ended up splitting a mediocre salad. I ordered a veggie calzone, expecting something delicious. When it FINALLY arrived, it was enormous and beautiful. I mean, huge! I believe there's a picture of this monster on the restaurant listing. Digging in, i found two types of cheese. Mozz and goat cheese (?). Texture-wise, it was strange because of the mozzarella's super melty-ness and the other cheese's not-quite-as-much-ness. The vegetables inside, once I found them, were boring. No italian seasonings, no char, nothing remarkable. And the marinara served as a dipping sauce didn't deliver either. I couldn't have eaten the whole thing if I'd tried, not that it would have been worth the effort. I read up and saw that other reviewers had better experiences. I believe the Mr. had some good wings, and I imagine that carnivores would appreciate a calzone with some spicy meats inside.

I was pleasantly surprised that they took my order and told me it would be ready in 10 minutes so I headed over to pick it up. When I got there I was greeted by Nick who was in the back and came right up, apologizing that he was in the back helping train some new employees. He reviewed my order and realized it was slightly incorrect and immediately headed back and fixed my pizza that had just been put in the oven. After only 2-3 mins he came back up, apologized and then proceeded to give me a discount for having to wait on him...I was so happy that I was even able to order 5 minutes before closing I would have taken any pizza no problem, but Nick made the whole experience exceptional.

I really like their traditional/regular crust. I think it has a unique flavor. I also enjoy their thin crust, which still gives you the satisfaction of eating a real pizza...Not so thin you feel you're eating an overgrown potato chip with cheese and sauce on top. Our favorite is the Barro's Special. Replace the green peppers with the jalapeÃ±os if you like heat. The place is also very kid friendly. Their cheese pizza is a staple at toddler birthday parties. Their decor is very informal, but comfortable. Not so fancy you feel guilty when your kids spill. The staff is mostly part time high schoolers wearing the Barro's uniform. They are friendly and mean well, though they make the occasional high schoolish mistake, which management is quick to fix.

About an hour and forty minutes after we ordered lukewarm pizzas and ice cold wings finally arrived - yes, not just room temperature wings that had been sitting too long but wings that were so cold that they had to still be refrigerated. The wings were fully cooked, just ice cold. So, do they serve frozen fully cooked wings instead of making them fresh? That would certainly appear to be the case based on what was delivered to us. When my wife called a third time to tell them that the wings were still ice cold they offered a store credit for the price if the wings. Like we are going to go back there again after this experience. If I want frozen wings I can buy them from the freezer section and cook them myself. This was probably the most incompetent pizza order I have experienced. To be fair, my wife and son had eaten there in-store once previously and their experience wasn't as lousy as this one.

Now that they put one in my neck of the woods, I was very excited to try this new location and also introduce my boyfriend to Barros. I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The only thing we ordered was a 12"" pizza. yup, a small one for us to split. Pizza's don't take that long to cook to begin with. Finally after 30 minutes of waiting (yes, I timed it), I go up to talk to someone and the girl sweeping helps me out. mind you, it's not busy at all. There's maybe five tables occupied if you count ours, too. She goes to check on it and brings out the pizza. Tells us that they're sorry, they messed up on the first pizza (which could be avoided by following orders) so they had to make another one. Good customer service would mean coming to tell us 15 minutes prior that they made a mistake and it's going to be a little bit for them to remake a pizza. We would have been totally fine if someone would have said something. Here we are thinking they just forgot about us. The pizza itself was completely unlike the one at the other Scottsdale location. When I think of Barros, I think of crust and how they have the best crust. Very bummed that it wasn't it's usual fluffy cust, but flat and barely anything there. Funny thing, as we finished our pizza, the people that had been sitting next to us for quite a while had an employee ask them if they got their pizza yet and they said, ""no"". The pros of this visit are that they have oregano you can use yourself, self-serve fountain drinks and They did let us keep the pizza they messed up on.

Of course, Rustic pizza is in the same shopping center, but good luck finding a spot to sit down. Barro's Pizza has a roomy interior, with plenty of seating. Parmesean and hot flakes are at each table, and a meager but tasty salad bar up front to help you stave off your hunger until the pie is finished. I went in and ordered a personal small pepperoni pizza, salad, and drink. I was given a salad bowl and helped myself to the salad bar, a drink, and then sat down and ate until my pizza was delivered tableside. The pizza was hot. Really hot. Right out of the oven hot. That made me feel really good -- I hate cold, warm, or reheated-tasting pizza. This was FRESH. The pepperoni was really spicy, and crisped on the edges the way pepperoni is supposed to be! The crust was dry, with a nice coating of corn meal on the outside, nearly perfect (If I had to really nitpick, the crust was slightly too bready). The moz cheese was good quality and it was everything I was missing from our local pizza places. I would like to see a better salad bar, with more options.

First let me say there is a nice young lady there some days who is pretty good. I have been at the plaza 2 weeks and this bars always dead. There isn't any good music of a feel. The bar area with the liquor is stale and seems empty. I tried the food but it was so salty and over cooked. I enjoy the beers but I was always the only guy at the place. Today I want to have a good beer and a young guy was bartending. He was leaned over the bar texting and didn't notice me. I LEFT! Sorry to bother you with my money. If I left the owners can bet others do to! I don't allow cell phones at my store and not sure why they do. Stand at the bad smile and make eye contact with the hundreds of people who walk by them. Invite people in. Make some money! Absent management sure to lead to a failure.,images/stars-2.png

You can order wings individually. Lots of nice pizza options. We ordered a cheese pizza, light sauce, side salad, chicken wings, and a Stromboli. The pizza was hot, cheesy, and the taste was good! The wings were cooked perfectly and I appreciate that we didn't get a ton of drumettes. The Stromboli was literally the size of my husbands forearm! It was way too much food for our family and we had leftovers for 3 days. My only disappointment was the salad, but it wasn't a huge deal. It had no flavor and the house Italian dressing had no flavor, so it was like eating an oily, watery moosh. Overall we would definitely give them another try.",images/stars-4.png

Italian Sub, GF Chicken Parm (with no cheese), 12"" cheese pizza and a side salad. There were no descriptions on the online order form so I went with what I know; and how I make Gf items. I figured the gluten free chicken parm would be breaded in gluten free bread crumbs. I asked for no cheese. I also thought a gf spaghetti or other pasta would be served. I was surprised to open and find that this was a grilled chicken breast, still covered in cheese, and served with cheese ravioli. Disappointed and concerned that my 3 year old would be unable to eat. My friend called and Biaggo said he would make us new food. I was really impressed with the level of service we received. They replaced the parm with a gf pizza, free of charge, offered to deliver (we declined but appreciated the offer), and they gave my husband 2 slices of cheese cake to go. Every single thing we ate was delicious. I honestly cannot say when the last time I ate gluten free pizza that didn't taste like cardboard was. This was amazing. The sauce is delicious. The Italian dressing on the side salad was better than anything we've ever had. Every bite was eaten without a crumb left. You've gained customers for life. We are amazed by your service and love your food. Thank you!",images/stars-5.png

Biaggio's crust is just right: crispy and amber-brown on the bottom, but not hard--it is pliant enough for anyone, even the dentally-challenged, to eat.

Biaggio's Pizzeria on Flamingo/Fort Apache was right next to a salon that I worked in, and this pizzeria is fantastic. I think it's a ""little known secret"" that no one knows about yet. Even though the owner (Biaggio) has an extensive menu, I always opted to order one of my favorites: ""the Art of Chicken"". Which is a homemade pizza topped with chicken (of course) (and lots of it), fresh artichokes, amazing roasted tomatoes (that I think makes the pizza so mouth watering), garlic and black olives. My habit of ordering was to get a slice of the Art of Chicken (which is crispy on the bottom; not too think and definitely not thin) and loaded with all of the ingredients above. (With a side of Marinara sauce). Biaggio's chefs are very ample on the portions... and I used to always order that traditional orange soda in a bottle called .. hmmm.. I cannot quite remember. Oh yes, when I first met Biaggio he told me that his wings were the ""best"". At the time, I did not believe him. I thought he was using a ""sales pitch"" on me. So I declined buying any. Well.. because I worked right next to his building, a few feet in my beauty salon next to his restaurant.. he sent over one of his chefs (a few minutes later).. with a full order of deep fried wings... complimentary just for me to try. YOU HAVE TO EAT THEM HOT and right when they are made. He was right!!! These were the best wings I have ever tasted. The skin and the batter was super crunchy and had an amazing taste. The chicken wings and legs themselves.. melted in my mouth.. literally. Not sure if I had chicken that ever did just that. But I only order them when I know I don't have to share. Biaggio simply is the BEST out there.. just like you are in NYC. (Love you Biaggio) (from your favorite flower Rose).",images/stars-5.png

The crust was what really made the pizza and what will keep mr coming back. The only reason I didnt rate it five stars was because the pizza had too much oil on it for me.

It was really good! It is on the greasy side but that's what makes it taste so good. I mean it wasn't overly or anything, just more taste than other pizza. I don't know I loved it. I also order out from time to time from this place. The online ordering system is quite easy to use. I don't beleive they give you a time of when they will deliver like some places but about 45 minutes sounds about right. If they have any questions for you they will call you and ask. I know one time I placed an order for meatball parm and I got the meatball sub and called it in and they made a return trip to give me the meatball parm :) that was very nice, I was more concerned that I received the wrong order! Very nice...very good on service too. I've had no problems with them that they didn't take care of me. Also the prices are not bad, very affordable. I love eatting their parm, it's like spagetti and meatball but with baked cheese on top that's nice and gooy yum!

As soon as I walked in, Mr. Biaggio welcomed me with a big smile. He treated me like a regular even though it was my first time in there. I'd give it 5 stars just for the excellent customer service (seriously, I don't think you can find any better customer service than at this place)! I arrived a bit early (for pickup) and before I could even sit down, Mr. Biaggio came over and gave me a bottle of water. Even before I left with the pizza, Mr. Biaggio came running over and said, ""Let me check to see if it's perfect."" Can you name another pizza place that does that? Now on to the food. It's seriously the closest thing to New York style pizza you can find here in Vegas. The crust is perfect..not too thin..not too thick. I ordered the pepperoni pizza, and boy, do they pile the pepperoni on! I also had the buffalo wings and just like Mr. Biaggio said himself, ""They are to die for!"". They were perfectly cooked with the perfect amount of crunch to them. And the buffalo sauce was delicious! I also tried the garlic knots and yum...they had a bit of a crunch to them but were soft enough to melt in your mouth. My brother, who is a very picky eater, said that if he could rate it from 1-10, he would rate it a 12. I'll definitely be back! And I'll be sure to tell everyone I know about this wonderful place (in fact, I already started that, hahah). Mr. Biaggio, if you're reading this, thank you for everything tonight!

Only to discover later that we got a chicken caesar wrap with broccoli instead of what we did order?? There was maybe 5 other customers in there besides us so it's not like this was a mistake due to being busy Sitting here right now, it just took 17 minutes for a vodka tonic to be brought to our table (the other drink still hasn't came) our server never introduced herself and doesn't come by.",images/stars-1.png

I went during the middle of a banana bar crawl so you can imagine the noise. Luckily they had a back room and they sat me rather quickly. The food was a good price but it wasn't the best. I ate the bacon wrapped meatloaf, sweet potato mash, and green Beans. The meatloaf didn't have any seasoning so that's what completely turned me off from it. The mash and beans were great. The spinach dip was the best part of my meal. My waitress, Judith, was also very sweet and she took great care of my table. I would go again just to try something else but I'm not really sure what I would get this time but I would try it again.",images/stars-4.png

I'm so glad there weren't any tables available at Fleming's because we were very happy with our meal. My husband loves iceberg lettuce wedge salad and Blackfinn's was huge. He got tons of bacon and really good bleu cheese dressing. In fact, he didn't want an entrÃ©e because he enjoyed the salad so much. I had a slightly dry Caesar salad with dressing that tasted good, but needed more dressing. My medium-well ribeye was tasty, but needed a little more moisture. It was supposed to have a butter drizzle, but it needed more. The bacon cheese grit cakes were the star of the show. They were crunchy on the outside and really moist and delicious on the inside. We didn't need dessert because we were very full. Thanks for being there for us, Blackfinn! We'll be back.",images/stars-4.png

At this point I cut my losses and tried to just pay my tab and leave...yep, 20 minutes later. As I was leaving I overheard a customer irate that they had placed a reservation and an hour past their alloted time they still had not been seated.

The place is open seating so we sat downstairs in one of the booths. The booths all have personal televisions attached (very cool). Our waitress was absolutely amazing, I wish I could've gotten her name. I ordered a Long Island iced tea and so did my brother. Our drinks looked completely different. Mine was clear I actually thought she was giving me another glass of water. My brothers drink had the faint brown color. Both tasted disgusting. The waitress said it was because the bartender used lemonade and that she could make it again. I declined and instead asked for a drink nobody could mess up. Or so I thought. I ordered a margarita and so did my friend. Mine looked like a margarita however it was terrible it tasted like soap. My friend's margarita came out next and hers was clear and tasted like salt water. We all sent our drinks back. The waitress kept apologizing even though it was not her fault that they have a terrible bartender. I ended up just getting a lemonade which she completely voided from the bill. I thought that was very nice of her. I gave this place 4 stars because the food was great. For dinner I had the iron skillet macaroni and cheese with blackened chicken. It was VERY tasty. The chicken was well seasoned and moist. Everyone at my able enjoyed their food. I'd definitely come back just to try another item off of their extensive menu, but i think I'm done ordering alcoholic drinks from this place. Hire a new bartender please!!!",images/stars-4.png

This was the first time I'd been here, the place was pretty busy but thankfully we had a reservation. The service was better that I'd expect for 1 server for 20 people, plus with the rest of the place being packed. The food did take a while to come out but that was pretty much expected with the volume of folks in the restaurant. I always had water in my glass so I was good while waiting. Someone from the table ordered some chips and dip. I wasn't really in the mood for chips and dip but figured I would at least try one. I immediately regretted that decision. The chip was soggy/greasy and there was absolutely no life to it to give it that ""crunch"". It tasted chewy like it'd been sitting in a pool of grease before being dumped on the plate. Gross. I ordered the lunch fish tacos. By reading the menu and being told by a friend these were supposed to be good, I was expecting some really good tacos. You basically get 2 tacos and some rice for $11. You can get them fried or grilled and I ordered the grilled ones. When the food finally arrived I was very disappointed by the portion of fish in the tacos and the overall flavor. I know both tacos combined couldn't have added up to even half of a filet. The person across from me even made a comment when the food was delivered, ""Oh wow you are eating very light today, huh?"". The very small bits of fish were piled on a huge bed of cabbage. When I took a bite I literally tasted nothing but cabbage and since the fish was so small only the 1 or 2 inner bites of the taco had any fish. No avocado or cilantro flavor made it through the overwhelming cabbage. The side of rice had a good flavor but I didn't order the meal for the rice, I was really hoping for some tasty tacos and man what a let down. I felt like I just payed $11 for a mouthful of cabbage. What a rip off. I'm not sure if I would try this place again. Maybe dinner would fare better, but I'm reluctant to try when there are so many other restaurants in the area with better selections. I would rate lower but the server was good and handled the large crowd very well.",images/stars-2.png

I went to blackfinn on Cinco de Mayo and asked the bartender if they had any specials. He said yes and preceded to tell me that they had $2 corona lights and $4 draft beers (not to mention he used his fingers to tell me the amount they would cost, so there was no miscommunication in pricing). I figured the $2 corona light deal was a good special so I ordered to. When I asked for my check (they already had my card so they paid it out) my total was $11. I asked the bartender why it was $11.00 when the other gentleman told me they were $2. The gentleman who told me the special returned and rudely told me that he said $3 (even though he definitely told me $2, besides it does not add up to $11). I then asked to speak to the manager and wanted to pay the price I was told. The manager told me there was nothing he could do except buy me a beer. He preceded to pour me a beer without touching a register (a beer I doubt he comped off, therefore stealing from the bar that he is managing. Definitely not sketchy at all)!

This place is A-OK I mean its just a really reliable go to place for food and drinks. They have 2 levels with a bar on each floor. I always end up upstairs for some reason though. They are a little pricey nothing to bad but while I always leave satisfied I'm not like itching to come back asap. I do like that they have a lot of tvs that make it an obvious choice for any sporting event that might be happening. The bartenders are ok they don't say much to you and you may need to flag them down should you need something. The food has always been good here I have to say. The other night I had the steakhouse salad the bleu cheese was outstanding and the steak was a decent cut. My guy had a turkey burger which was really good not a huge portion though which I actually prefer but he was still hungry after the man could eat all day long and not be full.

You remind me so much of college and I'm not sure that that's a good or a bad thing! I certainly don't want to relive that time in my life but it's so tempting at the same time! This is definitely a fun, upbeat, young bar. I went with a bunch of friends and all we did was dance all night long. The music was great, the dj was great and he played a nice variety of music for everyone to enjoy. It definitely was crowded and definitely was filled with the college scene, which if you don't enjoy, I wouldn't venture out here late night during the weekends. It's a fun environment but you have to have the tolerance! Drinks were relatively cheap for uptown in the epicenter.

The restaurant is actually nice and I don't mind it. I wish it was a separate business. The other night, a few friends and I were hanging around Epicenter and one friend suggested Blackfinn for a drink. My intuition responded with a loud ""No,"" since the last few times I've been there, the crowd has been weird and the vibe was off. Admittedly, it's been many months so I thought, maybe I can try it again. When we walked in, it wasn't as suffocatingly crowded as it is on weekend nights, but there was still a weird vibe and I felt a little bit uncomfortable in this place. The bartender was curt and seemed like he had a bad day or didn't want to be working there. One friend ordered water and the bartender rolled his eyes. One thing I appreciated was that the menu has all prices listed clearly. Still, our bill for three drinks was surprisingly high - and we are uptown regulars. If we at least got a friendly smile, it might not be so bad. I know the business cannot control who walks in the front doors, but it's always a consistent situation where other patrons make me feel uncomfortable here. One other individual at the bar was so overtly staring at me (I'm not dressed in any weird or slutty way) that my boyfriend had to shift his chair so as to block his view. As this patron left, he walked so close to my chair as to brush the length of my hair. There was plenty of space for him to walk by without doing that...

Food wise, we had three in our party and each ordered something different: 1) 14oz Ribeye w/garlic butter for side had the greens and mashed potatoes. Overall wasn't bad - green are close to traditional. 2.) Stirfry - vegetables are okay, could have used some heat in the sauce though. Overall the dish was just ok. 3.) pork carnitas - basic food, pork wasn't really tender. Overall - okay. Two people ordered drinks, a rum and coke and a Long Island ice tea and both drinks had two much ice in them and were watered down. The menu feels disjointed from the decor.

We were offered a preselected limited food and drink menu for the group and the choices were awesome. I would have been happy with anything on the menu I think, and the beer/drink ""limited"" selection was hardly limiting. I got the steak salad with Pinot Noir. I was extremely happy with my meal. The steak was perfectly medium rare, just like I ordered and the greens and veggies were very fresh. My boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich and it was really great too.

He asked for the sauce on the side because he thought it was going to be too spicy. It was served in a large bowl with more than an ample portion of shrimp. So of course he had lots to share. My sandwich was huge. I asked for tartar sauce but after tasting the shrimp sauce, I never considered touching the tartar sauce. The first time we came here, our server was Liam. He was such a cool dude and a cutie by the way. He also made sure we had happy hour drinks. This time our server was Joscelyn. She was so much fun as she helped us with the menu. She really made our dinner a delight. She was cute as a button too. The food was cooked to perfection. The catfish was so light and fluffy. Those fries.... mmm. Don't forget to try a milkshake. There's a tasty happy hour menu too. You can also visit Zane at the bar. The atmosphere is relaxed with a nice blend of shiplap and brick walls.

When waitress did come over, it was clear she had been outside for a cigarette break, and she wreaked of cigarettes. She forced her friendliness but it came off more as we were interrupting her work. Food took a while to arrive (25 minutes) and wife's grits (she had ordered Shrimp and Grits) were room temperature. She ate the shrimp which was ok, but the grease/butter was poured all over the grits and seemed to be more burned than Cajun. my son and I had burgers. They were good but the ""Cajun"" fries came out with no seasoning and I had to put the creole seasoning on that was sitting at table with salt (which looked like it had small bugs in it) and pepper. Father had breakfast. He ate everything but the potatoes which looked greasy. Server filled our drinks and reached over table after filling mine and grabbed straw out of it. Just seemed to have no class. After we finished eating, I wife turned to me and and said something about server. Next thing I know, she brings over a dirty dish and sets it on our table while she gathers our dirty dishes. She offers us dessert. When we decline she points to the empty dish and asks us if we are sure we don't want to try the Oreo pie because it's so good. I about fell out of my seat. Who has ever been sold on a piece of pie by pointing to someone else's dirty dish your server has placed on your table. Needless to say, we won't be going back.

Another pro is the milkshakes and drinks. I had the Orange Margarita and the Peach Milkshake, and My mother had the Strawberry Shortcake Milkshake, all three were delicious. Another Pro is that they give you huge portion sizes for a relatively low price. Cons: as far as con's the food while it looked beautiful, the flavor of the food we ordered was just Meh.

REALLY??? at that point i told her to cancel them, it was supposed to be an APPETIZER, which if she didnt know what that is, it comes BEFORE the main meal, NOT AFTER. as we are eating our meal, the manager comes over to our table and judging by what she said, we think the server told her something like we ordered the nachos after we ordered our meal. the manager, SUPER nice lady. ok, so now we are eating our meals, ill start with my son #1 had a burger, all ok, not great but ok, son #2 had ribs, again not great but ok, his shake, peach cobbler, tasted like vanilla ice cream with a few peaches in it, very bad. my wife had brisket and choclate shake. brisket was FANTASTIC, shake, not so much. now comes my meal, i got the southern platter....BIG MISTAKE, huge mistake. the shrimp was actually very good, the catfish was very greasy and mushy, the chicken fingers were over cooked, which was noticeable by the BLACK coating and was quite dry.the AIOLI dipping sauce tasted like pure salt. i got the strawberry shotcake shake, which was frozen strawberries in vanilla ice cream, NO SHORTCAKE at all, actually have better shakes at mcdonalds. we also got a burger and chicken fingers to go for the kids still at home. the burger was good, these chicken fingers were actually cooked well. i hope the server we had is somewhat new, if shes not, she needs to get a different job. the manager did take 10% off, but if thats the way food gets served when they are pretty much dead and almost no customers at all, i dont wanna go there when its busy. if i was in charge there, i would never let food like that leave the kitchen. i honestly doubt that i will ever go back, which is a shame, that place was so damn good when it first opened.",images/stars-2.png

Service was terrible, bartenders were unfriendly - all of the staff seemed clueless and unhappy. Very unwelcoming environment. We weren't going to ever go back. Fast forward . . . September 2016. By accident, we ended back at Buford's and have since been back a few times. They now have a happy hour (5-7 p.m.) with half priced drinks and appetizers. The bartender (Debbie) is friendly, happy, and welcoming. The management staff are new faces - they smile, and seem to care about their patrons. More of a local, casual, and happy vibe now. Although the deep fried oysters aren't part of the happy hour prices, they are worth it - delicious. Fried green tomatoes - tasty. Black bean burgers and fries - excellent. And, nothing was greasy. A successful restaurant is all about good customer service and good food (if you can be ""great"" - even better). If Buford's keeps this up, they may be packed during happy hours and will have no problem gaining more dedicated patrons. Great to have a local establishment to frequent again. Thanks to the owners for making the much needed change!",images/stars-4.png

They had some small mishaps for example no sooner did we get our appetizers which was a house salad and a soup that they told me was chicken vegetable but it definitely wasn't chicken vegetable and it wasn't that good, they brought our Meals out, which like I said was way too soon I was only six bites into my soup but I don't mind something like this so much because I would rather them bring it out to quickly than food sitting in the back under lamps or whatever, but the weird part about that was our sweet potato fries came out cold. The buffalo chicken sandwich I ordered was bland and had an odd smell to it the Cajun meatloaf was good, but overall the food was disappointing. We were rooting for this place, but I'm worried. On a last note the server was great no problems there very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu",images/stars-3.png

Fried green tomatoes, fried catfish, fried oysters, and it's it's not fried it come with bacon, pork belly, pancetta, or something else fried. So, this is a place you may want to stay away from if you're a vegan, or, a recent heart bypass or replacement patient. I started out with the green tomatoes, nothing special, a lot of salt was needed to add some flavor. Hurricane Katrina, my friend who can never order anything from the menu unless she asks 19 questions and makes 31 changes to the item she orders had the fried oysters. For dinner I chose cheesy shrimp and grits. Again, it lacked salt, pepper, and cheese. The grits were creamy, the shrimp were over done by a hair, tasty though, having seen some Creole seasoning in the skillet. This was a one and done for me. I wasn't impressed and way too unhealthy style of cooking. This is in the former Ground Round building in the Giant Eagle Plaza on University Boulevard.",images/stars-2.png

restaurants_list.html,Buford's Kitchen,http://mlg.ucd.ie/modules/yalp/reviews_L3ysePkSGjp11VIcmA3A-Q.html,negative,0,"I went here, solo, not long after the place opened. To begin with, it was very crowded, and I was seated at a table at a window. Ordinarily I prefer a window table, but this was an extremely cold evening, and they were having a heating problem. As in, NONE, and even cold air blowing. Most people, myself included, wore coats the entire time. I personally HATE to be cold, so this was strike one. When I was given a menu, I was astounded at how limited it was--mainly po'boys and build-your-own burgers, and very little else. Now let me say that when I dine out alone, I rarely check the prices because I choose places where paying a check for one person is never a problem. That being said, I ordered a peach cobbler alcoholic shake and a build-your-own burger. The shake was AWESOME, very flavorful, and you get not only a glassful, but also extra in one of those old metal shake cups. The burger, to which I added cheese and grilled onions, was a goodly size and was very tasty with good melty cheese and lots of onions grilled just right. Then the check came. I discovered that the shake was $10. Okay, it was creative and had a shot of booze in it, but still, it's just a shake! I could see $6, or even $7 if you really pushed it...but $10?? Wow. The total amount was close to $28 FOR ONE PERSON, add on a {generous} tip, and I feel that's waaaay too high for this area. So, given the extremely limited menu and what I feel is overpricing, it's very likely that I won't go back. Pity, really.

There were only a dozen or so people there. Once seated we had the pleasure of checking out all the ikea lighting fixtures thoroughly while waiting for the waitstaff to figure out if we really wanted eat here or not. Upon ordering our food and waiting about 30 minutes we were informed that they are out of potatoes (I ordered a baked potato with my sandwich) but could instead substitute it with french fries (which are made from potatoes right)? While after another 30 minutes or so our food came out as cold as could be. We attempted to eat instead of asking for another super long wait for another meal. But alas we had no silverware. I found some near the hostess stand and helped myself. Also, I don't think anyone ever refilled our drinks even though we sat there for over an hour waiting for our food.

I've been looking forward to this restaurant opening for months - I love cool burger bars, and this seemed like it would be one. Sadly, I was disappointed in almost everything. Lots of places these days allow you to create your own burger, but they usually offer dozens of different toppings, proteins, buns, rubs, sauces, cheeses, etc., plus they have their own custom burgers to choose from as well. This place has nothing but BYO burgers on the dinner menu, which cost $10.25. Twenty additions are listed, and half of them cost an additional $1.00 each. The server did come right over to introduce himself, and we placed our drink orders. Then he came back to confirm my drink order (a Bud Light). After that he showed up less reliably. It took quite a long time to place our food orders, somebody else delivered our orders, and he never came back to ask how we liked the food. We were one of his three tables at 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon. I got the Breakfast Burger, ""add cheddar."" The server didn't ask how I wanted the burger done and forgot to add the cheese to my order (I wasn't charged for it, either). It was an okay burger nonetheless, but nothing special. It did come with a handful of fries on the side - this isn't mentioned on the menu about this burger, or about the BYO burgers. My daughter got the Cream Cheese Stuffed French Toast. We were just totally confused by this item. It wasn't even pretending to be stuffed - just several (six? eight?) half slices of thin white bread French toast with a dollop of something on the edge of each slice. The online menu says it's an herbed goat cheese. Either my daughter didn't read it correctly or the menu in the restaurant was different, because she would never have ordered that. In any case, goat cheese is not cream cheese, so that doesn't make sense. We also shared the Southern Mac 'n Cheese app, which was excellent. The food was mediocre and expensive, and the service was terrible. I'll give the servers a little slack because this location is so new, but there are other local locations, and management should have arranged for the servers to train there for at least a few days before starting at this location. Because they didn't do that, they've had a poor opening, when guests are deciding whether to return and whether to recommend the place to their friends. I wanted to love this place, and will give it another try, but from what I saw tonight, they've got a lot of work to do to make this place great. I hope they pull it off!",images/stars-2.png

Where to start... Menu takes some time and lots of questions to understand exactly what you are getting. I had a cheeseburger that was just ok. My wife had an omelet that was runny and came with some sort of red gravy that was not good. The kids meals were good but the French fries were extremely over seasoned to the point that I could not eat them and I am a fan of salty fries. Then when the manager came around and asked how everything was, I mentioned the fries and she proceeded to tell me that she had tasted them and that she saw no issue with them. Not good manager skills. Just say sorry about that and get some new ones. To her defense she did get some new ones that were much better. Not a good start.",images/stars-1.png

The food is touted as Local Canadiana and they delivered a well thought out tasting menu that was delicious from beginning to end. We sat by the kitchen and it was interesting to see the bustle of everyone working, but it was very hot. I might not recommend sitting here if you are a Sweaty Betty like me. All the courses were wonderful. I I even enjoyed the bread that they served with chive butter and mascarpone with ramp confit. The wine pairing was the only element of the dinner that I found underwhelming. Normally, I expect a wine for each course. Some of them were meant for two courses and I would have finished the pour with once course in anticipation of the next. The other issue was the 'pour'. Wine was pre-poured and presented at the table with the bottle. I feel like with a menu this nice and service of this level that the wine ought to be poured AT the table. After all, the presentation is part of regular wine service. Grilled veal was succulent. Chocolate and sunflower was unexpected and wonderful.

When we first got there I thought it was a bit unusual that there were only two choices on the entire menu - a larger prix fixe tasting menu and a smaller one. Originally wondered about a restaurant functioning with such a limited menu. But that is the genius of it. For the chefs to just concentrate on the same complicated order rather than scatter their efforts and energies preparing dozens of individual a la carte orders, they get things down to a science and achieve near perfection. Every course had so many delicate subtle nuances with distinctive flavors and textures that there was a complexity to it. I got the feeling that this was a real labor of love. We sat at the chef's table overlooking the kitchen and it was a revelation watching this exceptionally happy looking staff practice their mystical art. Service was remarkably attentive and every course brought to us was given a fascinating description by the very diligent servers. This restaurant is a towering achievement.",images/stars-5.png

The cooks, chef, as well as the sommelier were interactive with us in being very attentive, as well as sharing with us where their produce is sourced, and answering any questions we had about the dishes. Every dish was executed and presented beautifully, and the flavors did not dissapoint. The highlights of the meal were the two tarts we received at the beginning of the meal (A beef tartare, sunflower, and egg yolk tart as well as a liver pate tart) which were light but also very flavorful and had a beautiful crisp tart shell. We both also enjoied the lamb as it was cooked to perfection, being very delicious as it was tender. And can't forget about dessert; out of the 3 phenomonal desserts we received - they were all so good, but if I had to choose a stand out, the sunflower and chocolate dessert was super unique and devine as the textures and flavors was something that I've never had in a dessert before.

restaurants_list.html,Canis,http://mlg.ucd.ie/modules/yalp/reviews_WP1e-VmnTW2K0A9dMCF10g.html,positive,1,"Came to Canis to try the dinner tasting menu. They have an 8-course option for $88 and a 6-course option for $68. We opted for the 8-course to get the full experience. As soon as we ordered, out came some fresh sourdough bread with two different kinds of spread. One was a garlic butter with chives and the other was a ricotta cheese spread with chimichurri toppings. The bread was nice and warm and the outside crisp, which was delicious to eat with the spreads. They have only a small selection of beers, but the burdock American pale ale I got was awesome. A little fruity, very smooth, and went extremely well with the entire meal. COURSE 1 (oyster, uni, parfait). The PEI Savage Blonde oysters were small but had a nice firm meat and tasty. The uni came served directly in the half-shell served on ice, very fresh, smooth, and delicious. The parfait consisted of duck pate with grape jelly with a hazelnut topping served inside a crispy tart crust. The sweetness of the grape jelly melded perfectly with the bold taste of the duck pate, and the crunch from both the hazelnut and the tart crust added some extra texture. This was absolutely delicious, I could eat an entire plate of this! COURSE 2 (salmon, turnip, buttermilk). This was smoked-salmon served on top of a bed of turnip salad with a nice refreshing buttermilk sauce. COURSE 3 (tuna, maitake, snail). The maitake was so aromatic and cooked perfectly to retain a slight crunch. The sashimi-grade tuna was just lightly seared so the inside is still raw and delicate. The snails were tiny but still very flavorful, tasty, and not chewy like some of the bigger escargots. The flavors of the three components really complimented each other and were absolutely delicious! COURSE 4 (mussels, potato, dill). The fresh dill and light cream sauce really went well with the plump juicy mussels. When you have mussels this fresh, it's so nice to have such a light delicate sauce that still allows you to taste the sweetness of the meat. COURSE 5 (cabbage, bone marrow broth). This was one dish I thought could have been executed slightly better. The bone marrow broth tasted like the most wonderful tonkatsu ramen soup that was condensed down until it was extra creamy and rich. The cabbage itself wasn't very special and since it was slightly burnt added a little bitterness to the taste. With such a wonderful broth, the cabbage just didn't do it justice. A few pieces of pork loin instead would have blown this dish out of the park. COURSE 6 (duck, confit, parsnip). The duck confit was an entire half a duck, which is a very generous portion for 2 people. The breast portion was so succulent and tender, and even the bone portion still had plenty of meat. The sauce reduction on the side gave the duck even more flavor. It was rather unfortunate that my steak knife was duller than a butter knife. It was very hard to get the meat off the bone with that knife and I didn't want to let any go to waste! COURSE 7 (pear, almond, buttermilk). The pear sorbet with shaved ice was a little sour but was an excellent palette cleanser after the rich duck entree. COURSE 8 (milk, blondie, white chocolate). This was one dessert that I wasn't very fond of. The salted caramel sauce on top of the ice cream was too salty for me. The blondie was good, but nothing special. Two cold desserts might be good on a hot summer day, but not great when it's minus 10 outside in the middle of winter. Would have been awesome to get at least one hot dessert like a molten lava cake instead. Overall, this was one fantastic tasting menu. There were a couple of dishes that could have been better executed, but the vast majority of the dishes were amazing. Unlike some tasting menus at other restaurants, each of the dishes had a very generous portion size. The single duck dish itself was significantly bigger than most full duck confit entrees at other restaurants. So all of this for just $88 was a real bargain! I would have to say this is one of my top-ten tasting menu restaurants. Will definitely be back again when they rotate out the selection on the tasting menu.",images/stars-4.png
restaurants_list.html,Canis,http://mlg.ucd.ie/modules/yalp/reviews_WP1e-VmnTW2K0A9dMCF10g.html,positive,1,"I liked the simplistic style and look of the restaurant. One of our friends was running late. The server curtly informed us that there was a two-hour sitting policy and that we would have to give our table back by 8 p.m. When A arrived and heard about this, she asked about the sitting time policy as it wasn't noted on their restaurant at all. Another server informed us that since there was another party booked at our table for 8:10 pm, we just had to make sure that we vacated our table five minutes before their arrival. We ordered the seven-course tasting menu. For every course that we had that night, there were at least 2 servers who delivered the food to our table simultaneously. You can expect professional and tailored service here. The first item at our table was the bread course which were three slices of sourdough bread set on a deep set plate for each of us and an in-house made salted chive butter and ricotta cheese with garlic to share. This was incredibly delicate and I loved the wooden serving handles for the butter and cheese. Our first course was a ""tuna, blonde cucumber, green tomato"". This was a salad deep set in a bowl with tuna, salmon roe, and carefully sliced cucumbers and halved fresh green tomatoes. It was an artistic presentation for sure. The tuna was hidden underneath the greens. This was a really fresh dish and I was pleased that there were more chunks of tuna fish within the bowl than I had anticipated. The flavours were fresh and definitely not strong at all. The second course was a ""beef tartare, sorrel, yogurt"". At first look, this dish is just a plain clump of grass. I've never eaten beef tartare in this fashion before with sorrel greens and I found that the texture was very different from just eating the chewy and soft raw beef tartare in previous meals. The third course was ""squid, pea, parcel"". This was a much bigger portion than I expected. Again, the dish was served in a deep dish where the ingredients were presented in the most beautiful way with edible flowers and even some chopped scallop bits (that weren't detectable at all but definitely there). The squid was prepared in ribbons and it made it look like we had noodles at first. I was also impressed with how much squid there was inside this dish! The squid was firm and soft; not chewy at all. The best part about this dish was the hearty broth that was present at the bottom of the dish. We took no shame; we all slurped and finished up this delicious broth before the bowls were taken away from us. The fourth course was a fish dish of ""halibut, lovage, scallop"". I was incredibly impressed with the taste of this dish. The halibut was cooked so that it maintained extreme moistness and firmness with the green sauce bursting into each bite. The greens on top, as R mentioned, were indeed a bit bitter and perhaps the only downfall of this dish. Everything else was delicious! The fifth course was ""beef short rib, broccoli, zucchini"". First, a large platter of the beef short ribs was placed on our table. Meanwhile, we were served the broccoli and zucchini on individual dishes. I absolutely loved the way that the charred zucchini acted as a ""boat"" for the broccoli florets to rest upon. Also, I loved how the stalks of the broccoli were sliced up and cut into squares. This was a delicious beef short rib course! The broccoli zucchini boat was good too but nothing outstanding in terms of taste other than earning dozens of points for its unique presentation. Health-wise, I didn't like that the zucchini was charred completely over. The first dessert was like a palate-cleanser. This was a ""raspberry, buttermilk"". It was called ""buttermilk snow"" by the server and there were edible flowers on this as well. To put it plainly, this actually tasted like I was eating soft snow. It was another highly unique dish! The raspberries had nothing special to them so the main draw of this dessert was definitely the buttermilk snow. Our final course of the night was the ""koji, almond, white chocolate"". This was a classic case of ""saving the best for last""!! In short, I loved this dish! I really like chocolate anything and the white chocolate ice cream in this was spectacular! The texture and flavour of the white chocolate ice cream was rich, creamy, and perfect. It tasted so good. I also really enjoyed the rich almond pieces that acted as art pieces to the dessert too. Such a perfect dessert! To our surprise, we were served a final finisher for the night. These were coffee canelÃ©s, ""a small French pastry flavoured with rum and vanilla with a soft and tender custard centre and a dark, thick caramelized crust."" They were really crispy and semi hard on the outside while its interior was soft and custardy. I think it's the perfect place for a foodie willing to splurge on an incredible meal for the eyes and for the stomach. The tasting menu cost $85 for seven courses.",images/stars-5.png

In fact, it is number 2 on the top ten list. I knew I had to try Canis when I saw that it was listed as one of Canada's best. It did not disappoint. The decor was sleek and modern. The restaurant was small and had a very intimate feel to it. The open kitchen made the space feel spacious. (It was fun watching the chef working behind the kitchen.) The service was friendly and attentive. The food was amazing. I did the $85 tasting menu. There were 8 courses (not including the bread). Using seasonal ingredients, Chef Jeff Kang was able put together dishes with unique flavours and textures. The dishes were innovative and creative. Some of the standout included the albacore tuna with artichoke, pork with brussels sprout and Chef Jeff Kang's signature duck. Canis is definitely one of the best restaurants in Toronto.

Interesting little restaurant (seating around 25) with a lot of energy - feel a real buzz in the air. Open style kitchen- literally. Sitting at the bar I got an unobstructed view of everything - stove, fresh station, prep station that also acts as a dessert station too. Service: Friendly and not rushed. Contrasts how the kitchen and wait staff moving frenetically. Optional starter - A quad of freshly shucked PEI oysters. Order it! So good in October - fat and plump with a dash of horseradish. 0.5 course - Beef tartare topped with uni. Creamy uni worked so well with the beef. 1st course - Venison tartare. Gherkins provided the vinegar enhancement - really enjoyed the crunch it brings. 2nd course - Albacore tuna. Not my favorite dish. I mistook the fish for some form of processed cheese. The capers reminded me of gherkins again. Liked it in the 1st course but not in this one. Perhaps I should tried the duck confit instead. 3rd course - Beef short rib with stuffed Hungarian pepper. Tender beefy taste. Hint of salt provides a dash of sharpness. Sauce is not typical - Mild bone marrow taste. The stuffed Cayenne Pepper is wow! Stuffed with ground meat that has complex spices. I like! Dessert- Frozen buttermilk like a Korean shaved milk ice with dried peaches, honeycomb buried underneath. Not too sweet, slightly yogurt flavor - a real adult taste. Along with a glass of wine, it was close to $100. Overall I really enjoyed the creativity and surprising flavors some of the dishes (0.5 and 4th).

Canis was very reminiscent of some of the best elements of BYO culture in Philly (no one can get a liquor license so some of the most well-crafted menus and star chefs have 25 seat BYOs) but with a wine pairing menu that took the guess work out of the process.

Food: we have tried a a few items on the menu Complimentary sourdough bread with fresh cheese and chimichurri- Bread was served warm and soft on beautiful wooden plate and cutlery. The cheese and chimichurri were both flavourful and delicious. Beef Tartare - Beef tartare was covered by the kale powder and you mixed the garlic aioli, sunflower seeds, pickled onions and chives well before eating. I put the beef tartare on the crispy potato chips and each bite was unforgettable. Ricotta Stuffed Pasta - Fresh ricotta stuffed pasta serve with mushroom sauce/broth. I could smell the fresh mushroom aroma when the dish arrived. The pasta was so juicy inside and sooooo good! The sauce/broth (the texture is not thick so I call it broth) was so good that we finished it all. Duck for two - The chef first presented the beautiful whole duck at the table before he return it to the kitchen to carve and plate it with wheat berry and onion puree. Then, the staff pour the duck jus to finalize the presentation. The duck meat was very tender, juicy and flavourful. I think it is the best duck I haven't had for awhile.

Very BLAND food, Very LITTLE selection.. They don't keep anyone at the carving station, sometimes you have to wait more than five minutes to get a slice of ham or turkey. sometimes they only have one meat on the carving station, never more than two. This is BAD; they need more options. Sometimes you wait forever for a refill on your drink, even if you ask. The machines aren't that far away but I was stopped from getting my own refill -- I had waited more than 25 minutes. I let a whole plate of food get cold because I needed a drink first. I said take this plate please. This one? Why? she asked. I had to say everything got cold while I was waiting for a drink. They have mashed potatoes and ONE other vegetable. SOMETIMES. The rolls keep running out; they have a basket of rolls like you'd have at dinner for four people. The butter is FROZEN. You can't put frozen butter on bread or a roll. The salad bar has more items that the regular food and the deserts are even bigger. They need to double the amount of food for the meal...and give it some flavor.

We got a Can Club card after check-in to take advantage of the $11.99 buffet (normally $14.99). When we got to the buffet we were charged the full $14.99 and were told it would have been more without the Can Club card. We checked the hours and date and should have qualified for the $11.99 advertised price. So either the ad was wrong or we were overcharged $3 per person. The prime rib was fine, as were the mashed potatoes and a few other things, but most of the food was average at best. The sushi? Methinks not. The shrimp? Overbreaded and nearing its expiration date.

There's not a lot of other buffets in the area that is worthy of consideration, unless you go all the way up to Green Valley Ranch or Sunset Casino. I have tried much worse buffets in town (think Palms) so I can't complain too much.",images/stars-3.png

I had eaten there about a year ago and wasn't impressed then...and it seems to have gone downhill since. My first complaint was, the buffet had been open for two hours and no one had put any utensils for the condiments (No spoons so a person could put onions, sauce, or toppings, etc.). How can someone not have noticed? Second, the fried chicken was so greasy and looked as it had been set out the day before,....and every piece was cut so the back of the chicken was the largest portion of the piece...how can this be? The ""homemade"" meatloaf was similar to the taste of cardboard...except..cardboard had a better flavor. The pizza looked worth a try but tasted like imitation grease and imitation cheese. I had a piece of chocolate cake with ice cream for desert and had no complaints with that. On the up side...there was no line going in and no babies crying or kids running around playing tag as, I being 64 years old,...was the youngest person there. The casino itself had many machines available for play, but I was so dissappointed in the lunch, I left with the intent to return and see if there have been improvements. It's March 8th, 2013 and I read my comments here and have not returned to the Cannery East but will do so again soon to see if there have been improvements and give them another chance",images/stars-1.png

So after a few years now of hearing that the buffet has changed, I decided to give it another try. One reason is that they had a weekend special where the buffet was only $7.00 for Can Club Card holders. So, was the buffet worth $7.00? Yes it was. Was it worth the normally $20.00 they charge for it? Oh no it was not. Some of the food was OK. Most of the food was very low in quality. I was also a bit confused by the station names. There was the Mexican food station which spilled over to the Italian food station which had almost overtaken the American Food station. I did like the spring rolls and potato soup a lot. The pizza was ok as well as the Orange Chicken. The roast beef though, argh! The beef came out looking like it was 25 lbs of meat. It took a long time to cook and thus it was so dry. Almost no pink in the center at all. Our server was great though. That it why the buffet gets two stars and not just one. Keep up the great service and bring up the quality of the food and I just might go back in the future. But for now, I will just stay away.",images/stars-2.png

Because let's face it, most tourists think dining in Vegas revolves around buffets! I never really read too much into other people's reviews but I'm really shocked by all the negative reviews! That being said I have noticed there have been a lot of postings and advertisements about this being the NEW cannery buffet so maybe it is dramatically different NOW as of November 2!? I am a huge fan of the ""quality over quantity"" campaign when it comes to buffets, I don't need it to be the size of a football field to be considered a ""GOOD"" buffet, for me I want the offerings to be something unique or if it's the same ol' thing I want the quality and flavor to be good. Cannery Row pulled this off for me!!! This is not the Rio Carnival Buffet where you can get lost in the shear size of the buffet, but there are plenty of stations with a large variety of food and it won't break the bank, a mere $5.99 for lunch! It seems to be reasonably sized to where the product seems to be kept fresh. We went at an odd time, about 3pm, so it was impressive that the food was maintained so well, we also received a dollar off for dining between 2-4 (something we didn't plan but it's good to know for the future). The buffet is completely self serve so you get your own drinks, I like that! I hate waiting around to order another drink or wait for coffee so kudos to them for doing that! They also had some of the best desserts I've had on any buffet. The cookies were fantastic and were only a close second place to the donuts at Boulder Station's Feast Buffet when it comes to tasty treats! We will go back in the future for the Dinner or Breakfast buffet but as for the LUNCH buffet they won me over and I'll be back!",images/stars-4.png

It's either old and dried out, too salty, too mushy, and/or just unappetizing. This is in a neighborhood with a lot of lower income families. While the price is right, the food is not. Value doesn't just mean the price is low. Value is when you get a quality product for a reasonable price. This is not a good value.

But if anyone paid full price, then I know they're not locals and I feel sorry for them as they make their way to the food. I rate server service based on how many times they refill my beverage. Almost every time I've gone they've been pretty decent, so I give them a 4. For value (fine, I'll base it on if someone actually paid) I give it a 1, because I feel this food is fancy cafeteria food.

There's a baked potato area with lots of fixings so you can make your own loaded potato. I generally don't eat potatoes, so I've passed on this each time although I salivate when going by. The Italian area has a cook to order section with ingredients such as shrimp, spinach, mushrooms, onions, peppers, etc. I generally don't eat pasta, so I pass on this, too! See a trend! I do eat their loin of pork, the pepper chicken in the Asian section was great yesterday, and the pot stickers were good. They have pork nuggets so you can put on your own sweet and sour sauce or Orange sauce which are in containers. The one disappointment was they didn't have these melt away confectioner sugar coated cookies yesterday. I really love those little critters.

I tried it when it switched to family style, where you order a big plate of each dish for like 12 bucks and get enough to feed 3 people per, and can share it... The food was good the first time, acceptable the second time and bleh the third time. When it swapped to buffet? Today was the first time I've tried it. The food was disappointing to say the best. Sean, and our friend and I ended up tossing about half the stuff we took. The crab rangoons were dried out and nasty. The lasagna was simply boring. The turkey was dry, and the desserts failed on so many levels. It's a shame they got rid of the good staff they had a year and a half ago when this opened originally. They also wouldn't accept a clearly marked ""Cannery Row Buffet"" coupon that was sent, because ""That was sent from the north location."" Nowhere on the coupon does it say it's only good at the one location, so technically you DO have to accept it. We didn't end up making a stink about it though. The 1 star is not because Yelp forces me to give at least one (which is bullshit)...

I went for dinner this evening and the entire visit was disappointing. After ordering our meals at the table, I stopped by the bar to get a drink and check the televisions. I ordered a Sambuca and the bartender did not immediately know what it was. She asked the other bartender who advised her to ask me if I wanted white or black. I responded white, but was poured black. It was slightly loud, but I believe she repeated white as the woman to my left even heard me say it. Paid for it and insisted on drinking the black as it was busy and she may not have heard me. Not enough to even be upset about. Next, I had ordered wedding soup as I have several times before. This time, it was almost all spinach and very bland. Still, not too bothered. My chicken marsala had arrived and the chicken was chewy and severely overcooked. Still was not going to say anything. Then, the proverbial straw. I had noticed Sam Adams Winter on tap while I was in the bar and ordered one as our meals arrived. Several minutes later, our server returned with an amber coloured beer. Before she even placed it on the table, I told her that this was not the beer I ordered. She left the table and within moments returned with the same glass of beer and said she was told, presumably by one of the bartenders, that this was Sam Winter. I told her Sam Winter was dark and this was definitely some form of wheat or white beer, probably the Sam Spring. She scoffed as she asked me if I wanted it or not. I said no and she walked away with no apology and even showed signs of being upset. As we were almost finishing our meals, she returned and told me that it was, in fact, the Sam Adams Cold Snap I had said it was earlier. This entire back and forth led me to write this review. It seems that the food quality has fallen as has the service and especially the bar staff. As a highly experienced bartender, I can understand not being able to tell the visual difference between different light beers, but to not be able to notice that a white or wheat beer is being poured instead of a darker bock or lager is beyond unacceptable. Even much more unacceptable is to return to the table with the same beer I returned once and telling me it is what I ordered. I highly doubt I will ever give this restaurant another chance.",images/stars-2.png

The meatballs were a good size and the marinara was chunky and delicious. The rigatoni was perfectly al dente. The garlic bread was standard. The kids Mac and cheese was very good!

Everything was, again, home made and ridiculously tasty. I got the Seafood Scroglio with angel hair pasta. The sauce was a little too oily for my liking but everything was perfectly cooked (shrimp, scallops, and clams), and the pasta was al dente. My fiance got the chicken parmigiano.

It's your local family owned Italian restaurant. I practically grew up eating their food so I might be a little bias. Personally I think they make the best Italian hoagie EVER. The bread is toasted to perfection...crispy, warm and crunchy. I live in VA now and the italian hoagie is cold and served with mayo here, no good. You really can't go wrong. Their marinara is great and goes well with the stuffed banana peppers or baked ziti. I crave the wedding soup and garlic bread on a regular basis. The chicken salad is huge, I recommend you get the fries on the side.",images/stars-5.png

Located in an older house, the restaurant is decorated in black, white and gray. It is simple and elegant. There is a pleasant bar with a full selection of liquors. The beer list is adequate and the wine list is limited but sufficient. Wines by the glass were only $4.25! Our bar bill for two martinis and three rum and cokes came to $16 plus tip. My husband had the prime rib egg rolls and seemed to enjoy them. He also ordered the pork chop. It was not large but nicely seasoned and tasty. His carrot soup was creamy and delicious. I had the Fettuccine Alfredo and it was quite good and cheesy. If I had one suggestion, it would be to heat or chill the plates according to the dish. The salads were nice. My Caesar was good but would be improved with shaved cheese and anchovy fillets. I ordered a side of asparagus. It was excellent - roasted and served with a perfect Hollendaise sauce. Steve had the cheesecake dribbled with strawberry sauce and he loved it. Dinner was an incredible $56 with tax plus tip. The chef came into the dining room several times.

restaurants_list.html,Di Manno Bakery,http://mlg.ucd.ie/modules/yalp/reviews_ydSiR7YyALkmmACVNtXzhg.html,positive,1,"Had lunch with co-workers here the other day. I'd say it's definitely the most pleasant casual dining experience you can get directly on the Portage strip between Jane Street and Weston Road. As long as you're not die hard on chicken wings or a submarine sandwich instead of some Italian options, this is definitely the place to choose from over the other limp options lying around. The hours are tailored around the typical business weekday, i.e., they're open quite early in the mornings, and do breakfast and lunch, Mondays through Fridays, although the hours sometimes seem erratic - they sometimes seem to close if it's not a very busy end of the day. I had the impression they should be open over weekends but, there have been many times I have driven by, hoping to be able to stop in, but found it closed. Maybe I'm not early enough driving by on weekends ... The food is typical Italian offerings (although you can get bagels in the morning) - you have the typical panini and pizza, and there are daily lunch specials that are better than your average hot table options. You don't just get a couple of choices of pasta - you will find options like roasted lamb and pork, and a nice selection of fresh vegetable sides and salads. The bonus with coming to a place like this during the work day is that it's cafeteria style service, so, as long as the line-up isn't too bad, you get served quickly, and pay at the cash before you eat - no muss, no fuss with waiting on cheques, tips, etc. The space is quite roomy with lots of tables inside, AND - yay for summertime - patio tables outside the restaurant. HOWEVER, caveat to the diner - you can't have your beer (or any alcohol options) outside. As you might expect of an Italian bakery establishment, you have plenty of great options for espresso drinks, baked dessert items, and gelato, although, I limited myself to my grilled panino for the lunch. Speaking of which, it was a grilled giardino (veggie) and goat cheese sandwich, and it was great! The vegetables (eggplant, red bell pepper, zucchini) were well cooked but not soggy, the slices were a good thickness, and the goat cheese was tangy and fresh tasting. The bread, no surprise that it was tender crispy with a fluffy inside - you can't expect less from any bakery worth its salt! Speaking of bread again, when you take your meal from the cash, you can pick up your choice of white or whole wheat buns and butter to go with the cutlery for your meal. That does mean that you do have to collect a glass and water yourself as well, no table service whatsoever, but, this is very conducive to the business breakfast/lunch setup of the restaurant. You aren't expected to bus your table yourself, either. The staff do clear the tables quickly because of the high volume, so that is perfect for the setup. I'm glad this is a lot closer to where I need to be during the workday than say, the Panera over in the Colossus plaza, because I'd choose this over that anytime. The value for the money is a lot better, and the atmosphere is a lot warmer, fresher and livelier in comparison. Definitely my go-to place for the area. No reason I had not to give 5 stars - I usually reserve that for something above and beyond that distinguishes a business but in this case, it's definitely because it's so obviously better than all the other options in the area.

I recently got hired in the area, and as an event planner for all the functions we host, people told me how they have tried Italian catering places and food was not good at all! So I had a lot of work to do to find a local spot that's great and can impress my colleagues. I got a flyer in my mail and it looked proper, I contacted them regarding their lasagna and pasta, and they were very quick to help. I ordered their Meat Lasagna, Vegetarian Lasagna, and Eggplant parmigiana with a chickpea salad, and pasta salad. I ordered for 30 people, and let me tell you something, their prices are very reasonable and the food was enough for all, we even had left overs and everybody fell in love with the lasagnas and eggplant parmigiana. The salads were perfect, and the chickpea salad is great for any vegans or Vegetarians. The main meals are great for vegetarians but not vegans. I ordered as well an assorted sandwich platter, that comes with chicken, turkey, prosciutto, and a vegetarian. They were all on focassia bread, and holy smokes this bread stayed ALL DAY FLUFFY, and not hard like these other restaurants that you go to, people were having them at the end of the day and their teeth weren't breaking like other focassia bread, and we ordered a lentil salad, and it was perfect, great for vegans too. They also didn't take charge us delivery charge unlike subway who is actually across from us and charged us $20 delivery charge!!! Their desserts are great, cannelloni are amazing, so are their cupcakes, and tiramisu. Honestly for corporate catering they are great and food is clearly fresh.",images/stars-5.png

Since they seem to consistently serve fresh, flavourful and quality Italian entrÃ©es, pizza and sandwiches along with good and attentive service, I'd say that is the type of establishment that deserves five yelp stars. I would recommend visiting for low key quick lunches (take into consideration that weekdays are loud & busy), take out or catering. I was really impressed with the breakfast basket and grilled meat and veggie sandwiches that were prepared and brought to us in time for our clients to enjoy throughout meetings. The catering pricing was quite affordable and competitive and the ordering process was headache-free all the way through. Thank you, Di Manno ladies :) Side notes: Cannolis are filled upon order so they stay fresh (I could watch that all day lol, mmm).

I explained that I did not recieve a phone call and that my phone had been in front of me the entire time. At that point he decided to switch his story and say that he called grubhub and it was their fault. To those that use grubhub, you know that when you or a restaurant have an issue with an order, you contact them or they contact you directly. Upon hanging up with him and talking to the nice lady at grubhub, I learned that he never actually contacted grubhub either. They were perfectly okay with letting us sit here hungry all night waiting for food that would never come. The customer service is why they're getting one star.

The top had ice particles on it and I couldn't get a piece off. Luckily the person I got it for wasn't home to eat it right away so it could defrost. The oreo cheesecake came fine though.

The chicken and fries were crispy and not drowned in buffalo sauce which I appreciated. Ranch dressing on the side was a nice touch, to keep the bread from getting soggy. The steak was great too, the lettuce hadn't wilted under the heat and the peppers and onions still had a bit of bite to them. Express uses Mancini's bread for their hoagies and it makes such a difference in quality. Delivery was surprisingly quick considering the snow.

The grilled chicken on the salad was tasty, but tomatoes were watery with no flavor.

The cafe au lait was tasty and I grabbed a day old bagel, both of which totaled out to be at an extremely reasonable price.

I had just so happened to have forgotten my headphones at home, so I was deeply grateful for the snazzy beats that were gettin' my head bobbin'. Today is yet another Sunday, and it is much busier than it was last week, but there was dang near a blizzard last Sunday, so I think that this will be more of the normal flow of things. I have only had their coffee, but I am someone who likes to try out different sweeteners and whatnot. So when I got over to the table with the sugar, I was pleasantly surprised to find white sugar, brown sugar, liquid sugar as well as some others that I am blanking on right now because I haven't had enough coffee quite yet. If you are coming here with a computer or tablet, I would suggest making sure that you are fully charged before you leave the house because, while there are some outlets, when it is this busy, you are lucky to get one. Oh, and if you like to people watch, then there are some great window spots from which to partake in the Willy St. visual delights. I also like that there are all kinds in here, and that it isn't super hipster, studious, trendy, shaggy, business casual and so forth. No need to feel out of place just to get some coffee.

Choose from hot coffee and tea drinks or something cold from the cooler to go along with pastries and sandwiches and soups made to order. Given its location, Ground Zero is popular with Willy Street area residents, grad students, and others of the ""mature"" crowd--weekends can be challenging to find a table amongst the laptop crowd tapping the free wi-fi.

Don't be fooled by the classic Decour or modern/country music - this place is all about the food and satisfying your hunger. We went in on a Wednesday and it was relatively quiet. Like most, we assumed that we were misled by other reviewers but since we already drove to the place we decided to try it out. I'm really happy we did so. We got the chicken wings, ribs, brisket, fries, beans, and, most importantly, the potato salad. The food was totally on point. The meat fell off the bone, was very savory and left you wanting to more. With the size of their portions, luckily we had more. But we just couldn't eat it. The staff were very friendly and we were greeted by the general manager who was an absolute sweetheart. She took the time to explain to us how everything is cooked and prepared and why there establishment was different than others. I'm sad to be writing this review because I do not want you guys to go to this spot. If more people found out how good it was then we probably would never get a table.

The service was quick and outstanding as was the food. We had an order of hush puppies and two pulled pork sandwiches. The sandwiches had enough pork in each that you could have made another sandwich out of it! The sauce was a perfect blend of tangy and sweet. The cole slaw and fries complimented the sandwiches perfectly. The only improvement that could have been made was to use a bun with a little more substance so that the meat and sauce didn't make it so hard to hold. Friendly employees and delicious food....what more could you ask. We will be back!,images/stars-5.png

Nice and close to our hotel and found a groupon so figured how could we go wrong. It was about 4 PM and only about 2 tables were taken. Surprising considering they have a Happy Hour every day that looks pretty decent. $4 small plates and tap beers and wine. I'm always about a good happy hour :) We tried the cheese curds and the wings off of the happy hour menu. Wings were very tasty although the the sauce was not spicy as advertised on the menu. It was tasty BBQ sauce though. I have to say that the cheese curds weren't very good. Maybe because I'm a Wisconsinite and we take our fried cheese curds very seriously. Not quite sure if they were overcooked or undercooked, but they were filled with water that took away from the taste of the cheese. The sauce on the side, maybe a chipotle ranch?, was tasty though and I kept that to dip my fries into. The boyfriend ordered a 1/2 slab of the baby back ribs which he said were very good but did mention that he wished there was a little more meat on them. My brisket was tasty as well and fell apart with my fork. A little fatty but flavorful. The service was good. We sat at the bar and the servers we very attentive and made sure to get us what we needed. 2 big TVs in case you want to catch a game. It's very nicely decorated A turn off was the way the food was served. It's served on a tray with wax paper on the bottom. This tend to tear and I kept finding myself looking to make sure I wasn't getting paper in food. Overall, a good place to come and try and close to many of the Scottsdale hotels and resorts.

This place was surprisingly not busy at all. We were greeted and served super fast! We started with the hush puppies that came out in a cute little basket. They could have been fried a tad bit longer as they were still a little mushy/mealy on the inside, but overall good. Then we ordered the sliders! Again they came out super fast!! This is a good choice is you want to try multiple meats at a relatively reasonable price. Lastly we got the Texas Rib and the grilled corn on the cob! The BBQ sauce and the meat were amazing. Very good flavor. The corn was boiled just a tad too long and a bit mushy, but still editable. The service was fast and friendly. We also pressed a couple of the drinks. The shandy and a mule!

Their old fashioned on tap rootbeer was delicious but they served it in a glass with ice which should not be the case, especially if it's from the tap and it's cold already. You wouldn't put ice in your beer would you? Our table ordered the hush puppies and onion rings as appetizers. The hush puppies were the best part of the meal, it was mixed with a little jalepeno and melted in my mouth. Before this I thought I didn't like hush puppies and now I stand corrected. The onion rings were either well under-cooked or the onions inside were just too thick. The batter was flavorless though covered in seasoning salt (which I enjoyed) and the thick, crunchy onion inside wasn't what I usually expect when it comes to a well-prepared onion ring. It was as if they were opposite onion rings with a crunchy center and soft outside. My dinner was the slider trio with a side of baked beans. The sliders bun bottoms and tops were attached together with piles of meat on top. Isn't the point of a slider plate to be able to enjoy three separate sandwiches? It was difficult breaking them apart, keeping the meat on the sandwich and at the same time trying to separate the pork from the chicken and the chicken from the brisket. The baked beans tasted like they added kidney beans and a small amount of other spices to a can of Busch's and they were so hot (temperature) the entire meal that I could barely eat them. Overall the meat was good but there are definitely better places to get BBQ in the valley (see my other reviews). I was also surprised to see nobody in the restaurant at 6:30 on a weekday. There were maybe 3 or 4 people at the bar and the other party in the seating area knew a few people associated with the restaurant. The service was excellent, they were very friendly and well-attentive. I'm also wondering if their location is what's hurting the business. They used to be Notorious Burger (an item they still have on the menu) but The Shops at Gainey Ranch isn't really a culinary hotspot in Scottsdale.",images/stars-2.png

The platter was only $12 and let me just tell you, you DEFINITELY get your money's worth. I ate everything on my plate. The chicken was tender, the ribs were very meaty. The baked beans were outstanding. Looked like 3 different beans they use and a good portion in a bowl on the side. The bbq sauce it was all cooked in was very tasty. I asked for more on the side and they brought it out right away. I wish I got the names of the staff, I didn't :( But the service was friendly and prompt and it looks like they all help each other out.

It did not occur to me what was wrong until I got home that both the fish and rice were so hard everything was not edible. Definitely appeared the order was not made fresh.

Small quiet restaurant that gave off a mom and pop shop. Friendly waitress that sat me down right when she noticed me. Their menu is in a form of a photo album with the name and prices on the corner of the photos. PRO: i finally get to see what i am ordering. No need for ""assuming"" how my food will arrive. CON: i had to flip through, what felt like hundreds of photos just to get to the lunch bento boxes. TIP: bento lunch pictures are at the end. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento ($10.95) and a spicy salmon roll ($5.95). The chicken teriyaki bento came with a miso soup, house salad and ice cream. The miso was delicious. Smooth and you can taste it's not made from powder. The house salad has a mix of radish, cucumbers and iceberg lettuce and the usual vinegertte sauce. The bento box came with two imitation crab meat sushi roll pieces, some seaweed salad, some glass noodle, white rice, 2 pieces of shrimp tempura, 2 pieces of sweet potato tempura, 1 cucumber and 1 eggplant tempura. I think, the chicken was chicken breast. White meat. Not too dry. The sauce wasnt too heavy. The chicken was on a bed of bean sprouts which was unusual for me. The shrimp tempura was not consistent. The first one i had was over battered then the second one was just fine. The spicy salmon roll was good, fresh, not a thick layer of rice and their spicy mayo was nice and cold (just like how i like it). Other than the photo album, the other weird thing was the waitress jusf standing there...staring at everyone in the dining room as we ate...

After we were seated the waiter was already trying to get our order. We just sat down. The menu was hard to navigate. It is a picture album menu. Another down side to the menu is that it does not indicate whether it is a daily or weekend special. As customers beside us tried to order a combo but was denied. Appetizer were standard miso soup and salad. Salad dressing on the salty and garlicky side for me. We ordered the medium tray maki roll combo for $37.95 and the golden treasure roll for $14.95.

I was quite surprised. Blue Fin Tuna set ($35) I actually came here just to try this.This is your real bang for the buck, where are you going to find 5 o-toro sushi, 6 o-toro sashimi, and 6 pieces of neigitoro sushi at that price?! In terms of quality I must say I've had better, but this definitely cures your toro fix. Only thing is when I originally saw pictures on instagram I saw a mix of cuts from the tuna, some looked like chu-toro and not just all o-toro - would have been nice to have a mix. Too much o-toro did make it feel really fatty and was a little too much to have all at once. Spicy Salmon Handrolls ($5.50 each) These were really good. The salmon meat went all the way to the bottom. It was mixed with some tempura bits which added a nice crunch. Unagi sushi and scallop sushi ($6.50 for each pair) The fish were fresh - good quality. The scallops were decent size, not the thin ones some restaurants serve. No Rice Roll ($15) Saw this in the menu and just had to order i! Normally when I go to sushi restaurants I hate it when they stuff the rolls full of rice and I'm usually the type that would start picking the rice out. Totally enlightened me as I never had a roll without rice before! How brilliant. But anyways inside was salmon and shrimp tempura wrapped in thinly sliced avocados, and wrapped it the outer layer. I'm not 100% sure what the outer layer was to wrap the sushi - it seemed too thin to be rice paper. It actually doesn't look too appealing but it was actually really tasty. Service was good, really friendly - the food came fast, and my tea cup was always full which is a huge plus for me since I always drink a lot of tea.

Ended up here when another restaurant was closed, and was pleasantly surprised to see that it was quite full. Waited for a bit, but got seated rather quickly. A very small interior space, but a good number of manageable tables. The menus are quite unique in that they are photo albums, featuring everything they have in photos. Just a little hard to navigate as they aren't really sectioned off. The photo album also hasn't changed over the years, so some of the photos are a bit outdated. My friends and I decided to go for the boat to get as much food as we could. The fish was quite fresh, but some of the sashimi cuts were so large, it wasn't that enjoyable. The sushi and rolls were amazing though. I have been here a couple times before and found that some of the items weren't that good. The gyoza especially were all soggy and flat. Not recommended. The service was absolutely horrendous though. We weren't given tea when we sat down, and had to ask for it! Our soup and salad came, but we didn't have chopsticks of napkins either. I asked for chopsticks, thinking the server would give us both, but only came with chopsticks. I then had to ask again for napkins. Towards the end of our meal, I requested some more tea, which the same server from earlier forgot. I asked again, just to give her the benefit of the doubt, but she forgot again. She would listen to my request, but then immediately go to do something else! I could tell she was getting annoyed with me asking her multiple times, but if she decided to use her brain, none of this would have happened...

It's not the best I've ever had but it's pretty good considering the area. I truly dislike many of the sushi bars in RH and Markham, especially the ones who consider it the norm to stuff the roll with mayo. I want Japanese food, not a miniature burger in seaweed with fish and rice. The bento box I ordered was more than satisfying, yet considering the reviews I was waiting for something a little more mind-blowing. Maybe I'll give the Sashimi and Udon a shot on my next visit. For those of you who've never been here before. Be warned, the tempura contains the odd slice of apple. Really. Apple in tempura.",images/stars-4.png

I used to come here all the time back in high school and through first year university. I then stopped due to the influx of all you can eat sushi restaurants. I recently revisited this establishment. Still running, still Japanese, still AMAZING! Upon entering, you see the refrigerator full of fresh sashimi ready for you to consume and the sushi bar with the master slicing away but immediately looks up to greet you with many hellos and head nods. Service can get a little slow during peak hours, especially at lunch as there are many offices around in which patrons will need speedy service. So if you want speedy, show up in a suit with a swipe card. When ordering, if you don't know what you want, fret not my friends but everything is in photo format and all you have to do is point and eat. I ordered a sashimi combo and this is the only place I know of that will give you the rare fishes. Not quite sure their names and along with the typical salmon, snapper and tunas there were other types that tasted wonderful but I couldn't name them for the life of me. Everything was fresh and the food came quite quickly. They do have bento box lunch specials but I would suggest trying some authentic rolls and sushi/sashimi as these are truly a testament to their longevity.",images/stars-5.png

I think it makes all the difference in noodles, rolls, rice, and even the delicate sizing of fish. You can find many dishes here that I have yet to see in other Japanese restaurants. The chefs bar is located in front of the entrance and you will be greeted by multiple head bobs by at least 4 people upon entering. If that doesn't scream authentic Japanese then you need to leave the country, go to Japan, witness the head bobs upon arrival, come back to Canada, then come back here and tell me it's not authentic! Here you will taste the most succulent fish and most delicious rolls in this fair city. The inside is very small and the location isn't great but the food definitely makes up for it. The inside is decorated in typical Japanese fashion with paper wall dividers and bamboo accents. This restaurant is located in what can only be described as an Asian mall for food. Picture a small strip mall where the only thing located inside are restaurants, a spa, and a convenience store. It is the strangest mall I've ever been to but Ichiban is here so it makes it all better. Overall, my favorite place to grab sushi that isn't all you can eat. When I want some quality sushi or even just quality food I look to Ichiban to dish it out. Prices here are reasonable and more than worth the quality food.",images/stars-5.png

It stands for UNWICH. FRENCH. WHEAT, you dumbass. I ordered a veggie sub that was already supposed to come with avocado. I asked the girl making the sandwich to add sprouts, peppers, oil and vinegar, and mustard to it. During the order she also stared blankly at me. So blankly that afterward I told my husband, that girl didn't listen to anything I said. But I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt because it wasn't a crazy request right? Guess what it came with? None of that. They also didn't put in the avocado. So here I am with a tomato, cucumber and cheese sandwich... yay.

Its always missing cheese or they give me a #5 with all the condiments on it (im the pickiest eater in world and hate condiments on my sandwich). I can understand how a slim 5 and #5 could get mixed up but the other 4 times, the cheese is missing! How difficult can it be to put cheese and meat on bread? Really now. Maybe if the manager would stop juggling sandwiches, dropping them on the floor then serving those sandwiches to customers, and pay more attention to what the staff is doing, there wouldn't be a problem. But when I see the manager messing around plus 12 employees working, I can't even understand why the hell they forget the fucking cheese!!!! Ridiculous. I called and complained and left a survey for corporate, now they're blowing up my phone trying to ""make it right"" with me, again, for the 5th time. And calling me as much as they have is harassment. This is how you make it right Jimmy John's... PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

It's clean, stylish, the wait staff is attentive and friendly, the food is great and reasonably priced! And for Mother's day (which was also my mother and I's first visit) they presented her and any other mother in the place with a nice red rose! That was such a wonderful gesture! Mom had the Tuscan sandwich, which she raved about (shocking because she's very picky about her roast beef) and I had the Lucca burger (again, shocking because I usually don't go for the turkey burgers). This one, however was great! Nice and juicy and flavorful! The only reason this review is not getting a fifth star is because of two things: when you order a meal that comes with fries you get the choice of sweet potato or regular. I requested regular but got sweet potato. No biggie, especially when the sweet man that brought the food over rushed back to the kitchen immediately to fix the problem. I'm not a fan of sweet potato, but I did try one and it was nice. The regular fries are good too. The other reason is how you enter the place. You can come in from both sides and it can be kind of confusing coming in from the back (you can't tell from outside though), but we were greeted immediately by no less than three employees, so this is just a small ding. I hope this place makes it; the location is kind of cursed. No business seems to make it past a year, but if Joey and Gina's keeps up what it's doing, it'll sure make the long haul!

Super friendly and fast. I really liked the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant and the patio. Food just fell flat. My daughter and I went after a movie and sat outside. However I think my daughter was allergic to whatever potted plants were on the patio. Anyhow, onto the food. We only had the mozzarella sticks and a pepperoni pizza. The sauce with the fried mozzarella was very flavorful but the cheese was just ok. The pepperoni was perfectly spiced and that was only thing good about the pizza. I think it could've used some additional time in the oven as it just seemed soggy in the center. I hate to send food back at a restaurant for obvious reasons so I choked down one piece and my daughter ate most of her slice. We paid the bill and left. I don't want to trash the restaurant based on one experience so maybe we'll try again and order an entree instead of pizza :)",images/stars-2.png

So my wife and I split a Pasta dish and a Cesar solid, one drink a piece...$53.00. We asked for our check, it took 35 minutes to check out. I would understand if they were busy, but no one was there.

Finally it came. The poutine was less than acceptable, the cheese sticks and smoked meat sandwich I'm sure we're bought at Costco. And the romaine on my Caesar Salad was limp and not crunchy. It the meantime my water had been sitting empty for most of the meal. When we got the bill, and I was going to pay in cash, they weren't sure if they could make the change. They did.

Whether I'm dining in or taking it with me, the service has always been typically Thai: friendly. Their prices are reasonable and in-line with the other standard Thai joints I've been to and so I find it a good value. You can expect all of your Thai standards here. There's no stand-out dish but everything I've tried has been good, even if expected. I certainly recommend this place for take out or for a quick bite however I don't suggest it for a special meal out or even one where you plan on doing a lot of intimate talking as this place is bare and QUIET: no background music or anything and if there's another table seated in the restaurant, you can usually eavesdrop on their conversation. The place is small and in the winter, if you're seated near the door you'll often feel a cold gust of air every time the door opens, even with the new entryway they installed. Anyway, I posted photos of the menu and the last meal I brought home.",images/stars-4.png

I've ordered the pad thai (a bit too salty for my taste, but extremely flavourful) and green and yellow curry dishes here. The curries were very good - good cuts of chunky chicken and enough sauce for three bowls of rice. I wish the dishes came with rice though cause their sauce is so good. I've never seen this place full since the decor is not that inviting and it is rather dim in there, but I'm glad I walked in and tried it.

The quality of their food started out as meh and has become abysmal over the few times we ordered from them. They progressively have made mistakes on orders and tonight was the final straw. We never remotely considered this good authentic Indian as they clearly cut corners. Ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Korma. Asked for Marsala to be mild and Korma to be medium. Also ordered x2 naan... They used the same sauce for both dishes but added a hint of butter and more yogurt to the korma. We seriously couldn't tell them apart at first. Both were definitely hotter than medium instead of what we requested. The naan was stale and hard as a rock. Seriously it was like a cracker it was that dry and hard. We called to explain our disapproval and asked how they would like to fix this for us. Their response...verbatim... ""I asked him and he said he did not put anything more in the sauce."" ""All naan is going to dry out after 20 minutes of waiting"". No offer of restitution. No apologies. By the way...we ordered by phone and I was literally out front waiting 5 min after the order as I was in the neighborhood. I also live 5 min away. Nothing was waiting for 20 min. Naan doesn't turn to a saltine in that amount of time. This garbage they sold us was sitting around for hours if I had to guess. The food sucks. The service sucks more.

Also, to clarify, there is NO alcohol served here now. I was very sad when the Afghan owners sold their restaurant--the food was fabulous. That said, I love southern Indian food and was pleased the first few times I ate here under the new ownership, even though they had NO chutneys, lime pickles, etc on or off the menu. Sadly, the quality has been sliding down with each visit. When I went this week with my family, the meal started badly and continued that way. The pappads were awful, stale. When I informed the waitress, she went in the back, then returned saying, ""Oh, we tried to keep them crispy but the kitchen must be too humid."" She didn't take ours back or offer us an appetizer. Instead, they sat there on the table, untouched, until we requested that she take them back to the kitchen. For the rest of the night, I listened to her warn guests that the pappads were a bit ""off."" Good grief. Still, we didn't come for the pappads, so onward. As usual, we ordered a LOT of food: chicken and paneer pakoras, poori chana, butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, and more. Alas, everything seemed like reheated leftovers.

Having had my fill of many a documentary from Forks Over Knives, Fat Sick and Nearly Dead, Vegucated, Food Inc, etc... I did take the plunge and moved to a vegan diet in Oct. of 2011. I have to say, giving up meat and dairy was not easy, but it did provide a huge benefit. The end result, I felt great. Energized in both mind and body, sleeping was restful, and waking up in the morning was a breeze, losing the extra weight was a plus. I suggest everyone try it at least once. Getting to the point, had I tried Rubs back then, I believe my attempt on the path to better health may have been greatly obstructed. This place is really that good when it come to true smoked BBQ. Don't be fooled by the fakes out there attempting to pass off some boiled ribs or meat doused in a lot of commercial BBQ sauces that are bought by the gallon. Give up the notion that a place like Baton Rouge, Montana's, Bar-B-Barn or Houston's actually serves edible food, they simply don't! Ergo it is for years that I have avoided them at all cost, and to this day I would rather go hungry. That being said, my experience with Le Fumoir Rubs only began because some good friends from far out of town were asking to go out for some ribs. When I heard the foul words ""Baton Rouge"" come out over my phone as a suggestion, I simply shuddered and asked that he call me back in 5 minutes. Low and behold, many a yelper helped steer me towards the light or in this case the smoke that is Le Fumoir Rubs, whereas eight of us experienced for the first time a true blue BBQ place in Montreal. Le Fumoir Rubs, made sacrificing vegan-ism worth it for at least a few hours before I embark back on my path to healthy eating. End result, yes it was a cheat, and a big one at that (there have been a few over the year, Icehouse for one could not be resisted), be it as it may, guilt ridden and all, the food and service here is well worth it. Temptation won out only because of the quality of this meaty, succulent and smokey fare, but I do believe it helps that no one else (so far in my now limited experience) does BBQ so well in this city.

Walked by Le fumoir Rubs and we had to turn around to check out Le Fumoir Rubs' menu, because it just smells soooo good! We never made it to the restaurant we were suppose to have dinner at, and ended up having 2 dinners at Le Fumoir Rubs on saturday, and back for more on sunday afternoon before we headed home.

We also enjoyed a tantalizing taste of ""bar bacon"" basically bits of roasted bacon fat. o.m.g. amazing again! Love love love this place and cannot wait to go back.

First day I was invited by my co-workers for a lunch. I ordered the Sliders to test out the Brisket, pork, and chicken all in one meal. Holy crap the portions were huge. So huge that I went the next day and ordered just the sliders for my girlfriend and I to share, and we were both satisfied. The smokiness is just enough to add a delicious flavour and not overpower the meat. You can taste the difference between meats as the smoke is just right. Sweet potato fries were great. Mac and cheese was creamy (very kraft dinner like) but with smokey flavour. If I were to go back the 3rd time, I will get either the beef ribs or the brisket sandwich. The fattiness of the brisket realy won me over, it was divine. Can't wait to go back! Prince Arthur is back. Btw - the watiers are the nicest people ever.

I was wandering around St-Laurent during a street fair and decided to check out Prince Arthur street for any new restaurants and low and behold, this fabulous American BBQ is right around the corner! Extremely pleased with the whole experience. My companion claimed the pork ribs were the best ever had and my smoked chicken was so tender and juicy it was falling off the bones. Side dishes are superb, mac and cheese with a hint of smokiness is nice and creamy, not an overpowering cheese combo (cheddar and gouda). Sweet potato fries were fresh, beautifully orange and ""plump"". None of that wrinkly, dried or soggy stuff you'll find in some other places. Regular french fries were also amazing. Food is delicious so we'll definitely be back for more and service is something remarkable as well. Our orders were fast to arrive and staff was friendly and welcoming. Everyone was all smiles from the entrance to our exit! Our waitress in particular did a great job explaining the food and even custom picked a cocktail for me. Drinks are the only thing I wish they expanded more on their menu. I saw quite a few people with fun looking cocktails in mason jars or margaritas but there are no mentions of the specials anywhere so you have to ask the staff. Perks for liking them on Facebook - they were offering complimentary bacon bits, seasoned with their dry spiced rub (I personally found too spicy). Prices are reasonable, the atmosphere and decor is quite warm and laid back. Everything has this rustic, wooden, barn feel to it which matches the BBQ concept perfectly. I've seen many restaurants fail in that area other the years but I'm hopeful this one will be a classic- Rubs Steakhouse has all the right ingredients to succeed.",images/stars-5.png

Another great newcomer, we went here to try out the new kid on the block and I am happy to report they are going to be a new must try. We were three and wanted to sample as much as possible so we ordered large, what we did not know if that every dish is a huge and generous portions, so be sure your hungry. We sampled the ribs of course both porc and beef, the winner for us was the pork, but we are partial to the pig so it is expected. Next on the list were the chicken wings, they were good and had a great smokyness we asked for some hot sauce and were given two kinds one in a jar and one homemade, the house sauce was by far the best, yes it's hot (which is good), but was also really tasty (me thinks coriander but I could be wrong) do try it. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was great but I did have to forgo the bread, sometimed you have to pick your battles I went for the protein. The sides choices were mac and cheese, fried sweet potato, french fries, smoked beans, coleslaw, and grilled veggies, all tasty my faves were the beans, fries, and grilled veggies (corn on the cobb was really good). As for the cocktails you must try the mexican bomb (Margerita with a corona inside), and the strawberry/lemonade with vodka slush.... The place is nice and spacious and the owners and waitstaff are super friendly, one can tell they care about their clients and food, and want to satisfy, which they do, so kudos to them and let's pass on the love fellow yelpers, fyi, the prices are really reasonable for the quality and uniqueness, this place definately rubbed me the right way",images/stars-5.png

When I went to the original Lola it was a hot Arizona day and I desperately needed a refreshing beverage. When you walk inside you instantly smell the delicious scent of coffee beans. I ordered a lemonade. It was lemony and tart and cold and sweet and defiantly refreshing. It was everything you could ask from a glass of lemonade and more.

Dont buy alcohol here because their liquor license wont let you take it to the games, buy from the culinary drop out instead (confusing since they all seem connected).

restaurants_list.html,Lola's,http://mlg.ucd.ie/modules/yalp/reviews_cILk7PnJBxNsMmGhQU2cyA.html,negative,0,Service is pretty horrendous if I might say so myself. The only thing giving this a 1 star is the decor and the manager that I will talk about later in my review. Definitely Not a fan of the girl working on 5/24 at 11 being a bit to touchy feely with my boyfriend sitting next to me and calling him baby and sweetheart all night(in which he knew and plenty of other people I told about her actions knew why I would be livid). That is the reason for the 1 star mostly along with the burnt slider she probably told the chefs to burn on purpose. The fact I have to get up and help myself to my own water since she failed to ask me at one point after I finished my first glass of water if I needed anything else or different. The manager (I think) helped me more than she did and directed me to where I needed to go; since she is obviously a horrid customer service employee not noticing that if I empty out of glass and not ask if I needed anything further is a tad annoying. Asking once if I need anything isn't enough if you are a server/waiter/bartender. But apparently in her eyes it's okay to just care about the a girls boyfriend and pissing off girlfriends at this bar. The sliders were not really pleasant and i had been drinking too so you think they would be more than tolerable but good god they were so charred. Nothing I would reorder unless they didn't burn the burger so much. The bacon made the whole sliders were the only thing keeping me from not touching it completely. Will I be back? Maybe if they got rid of the bartender touchy feely lady that got me all riled up. If she is there next time i can promise you that management will be notified at that point if she starts being her inappropriate self. I'm severely tempted to write a letter of complaint to the company if they don't read these since I have never felt so disgusted in my whole entire life going to a restaurant/bar. Being Disrespected in the slightest is what i have no tolerance for what so ever and she crossed every possible line and worse by not even asking me at one point if I would like one thing after I finished my first glass of water. When i was going to pay for our tab and my boyfriend hurried so he could sneak in her undeserved tip and our balance she had no idea that we were even on the same tab since I apparently wasn't allowed to order anything for myself. I literally felt like this was some kind of joke like I should have been on one of those shows like Restaurant stakeout. *threatened by kindness and spunk to my boyfriend alone. Not to me. When you come to a restaurant you would hope for consistent service not once at the beginning. That's like getting seated at a restaurant and not getting any service afterwards. I love how people want to say that I am wrong and not making a factual speculation. Good god people. ***update it is currently 8/31/14 and no one from management has obviously reading these reviews which is a shame. Lack of concern on their part id say.***,images/stars-1.png

I came here for breakfast hoping to find a good cup of coffee, something to eat and wifi to do some work on my laptop. They did not disappoint in that respect. Great cafe latte, they had wifi and my egg white omelette was edible - and I'll stop at that. The word palatable or delicious would only be used to describe the herbed potatoes (come with the omelets) if a gun was put to my head. In fairness, not much you can do with potatoes if you choose to serve them. But that's the point, don't come here for a delicious breakfast. Some people ""do breakfast"" and don't really focus on decor or ambiance; this place is about the latter, not the former. Lola apparently also just opened as the cashier and cook both responded to questions with ""I'm new here."" Why would I be talking to the cook at a restaurant you're thinking? Well, I was given a number tab by the cashier which would ordinarily cause one to believe his or her food/drink/order would be brought to him or her. Nope. After about 5 minutes the cashier brings me my latte and says, ""It's been ready for pick up at the counter."" As I look at the tab I think, ""Why did you give me this then? "" A few minutes later, the cook yells out, ""Number 2 is ready."" That's my cue I guess. The tab was apparently in case I forgot my number. When I asked the cook for a knife and fork to eat the food is when he explains ""He's New"" and has no clue. The cashier points me to the plastic knives and forks on the counter. As I walk my food to my seat, I pass a station where silverware is rolled in a napkin so I grab that and leave the plastic for the more adventurous.",images/stars-4.png

Let me start with the food. If you've never eaten authentic Spanish dishes, you'll be pleased. Otherwise you'll be disappointed. The olives were good. The shrimp dish (gambas al pil pil) was also decent. The traditional paella was good but more a risotto than a paella. Too creamy, different kind of rice (at least the texture is different) but the saffron hint and the chorizo were tasteful. The tortilla was ok. A little burn and dry but pretty decent. The wine selection is limited and most of the wines are NOT Spanish, AYFKM? They had one Rivera del Duero and one Rioja. Come on, you have a Spanish themed place and no Spanish wine? Now the coffee. I tried the cold brew and the kopi luwak. Both pretty good. The coffee paraphernalia is also worth the visit! If you are caffeine sensitive, this might not be for you. I didn't check if in the menu they include ""cafe bombon"", a Spanish classic. I'll go back to verify that and if not, at least to get good coffee! Cheers",images/stars-4.png

Not something I can do all the time, but I AM still waiting for my grade in Public Affairs research, so I hopefully will be treating myself again...soon!

Second let me say I was a HUGE fan of Lola's Tapas in the old location on Camelback. Lola's was always loud, always chaotic, always fun and always expensive. But the energy, the Spanish wine, excellent Tapas and quirky vibe was well worth it and made for a great night out! Parking = nightmare as it is every time you go to the Yard. The space is FAN-EFFING-TASTIC! All of the coffee accoutrement is exciting! We loved the atmosphere, the finishes, and the tremendous energy of all the people playing Ping-Pong, and all of the games out in the yard. However... there were only three tables with people, including us. So the vibe was off with the disparity between the two worlds. The staff was nice, not very up on the menu and a bit inconvenienced by us and/or they were so new they didn't realize that customers are a good thing? I still can't decide... After we ordered Walter came by and introduced himself. I found out a few days later he is one of the owners. I have to say I was put off by several of the things he was telling us. 1. They haven't started advertising. Explains the customer situation - almost a month after opening. 2. They are getting rid of the Spanish wines in favor of California wines. I asked "" Are you trying to make the wine more approachable?"" to which he fumbled a halfhearted yes. My instinct is that maybe Walter does not like or understand Spanish wine and does like California wine. Maybe it is just me... but if you take away the second most important thing about a Tapas bar - the Spanish wine - you can't expect to survive as a Spanish Tapas Bar for very long. I suggested he add a few more Cava to the menu - I don't think my suggestion went far based on his lack of enthusiasm as the conversation shifted to: 3. They are changing the menu and removing some of the Tapas and adding Paella. Now... I LOVE Paella. Between my friends and I we have two or three 36-48 inch Paella pans with the grills to cooks them with and a half dozen of the smaller Paella pans. Walter was kind enough to wait while I searched for an old picture of me cooking a 48 inch Paella - so it was off putting when Walter asked me what my favorite Paella was and I told him rabbit and he stood there with his mouth agape. He said they were going to have vegetable, chicken or seafood Paella. Ok. Just a suggestion but has to be REALLY good - because mediocre Paella is horrible. Not that it can't work or be a great addition, but had better be really, really good. Now to the food: We ordered the Shrimp, the Steak, the Jamon and Cheese tray and a glass of the one and only Cava. The Cava was good, ok quality = B- The Jamon and Cheese tray - had some lovely dates, Jamon was nice but cold like it just came out of the refrigerator instead of being hand sliced at room temp. The Cheese was ok and the Marcona almonds were fine = C The Steak arrived on a regular plate - not the traditional Tapas clay dish. The steak was thin, of poor quality, overcooked and luke-warm. The plate was cold and hence why the steak was not hot. The steak didn't have the cumin like at the old Lola's - instead it came with a blue cheese crumble on top, needed salt and pepper = D The Shrimp also arrived on a regular plate that wasn't heated. The first few were great, reminiscent of the old Lola's flavor and pizzazz. Then, because the plate was so cold the shrimp cooled quickly and lost their pizzazz. Started out as an A and quickly cooled/congealed to a C I sat there basking in the romantic wine soaked memories of the old Lola's - all of the chaotic energy, bumping into people, yelling over the music, laughing, spilling wine on someone and buying them a new glass as an apology, reaching for that last olive, anxiously waiving down the rushing waiters furiously trying to keep up with the second or fourth round of orders of the shrimp and wine, striking up conversation with the people next to you... With this excellent space, all of the new coffee equipment, all of the frenetic energy of the Yard Lola's Tapas should be a huge hit. I sat there willing it to be better, to match the quality of the space, the quality of the coffee equipment the quality of my memories. I truly hope they don't get rid of the Spanish wine or Tapas. I hope that they go full Spanish traditional with the clay tapas pots piping hot (just a suggestion). I hope they add more Tapas like the Croquets con Papas y Jamon, Roast Suckling Pig, Spanish honey with Manchego or Mussels with Cava and Chorizo, Fideos with Chorizo. I hope they add more Cava, and/or more... dare I say it... Spanish wine. We will give the time. The Lola's of old deserves the chance to be reborn in this amazing space.",images/stars-2.png

I was at the new Lola Coffee Bar at the Yard on 7th Street. They sell Kopi Luwak for $15 a cup. What is Kopi Luwak you ask? Kopi Luwak or civet coffee, refers to the seeds of coffee berries once they have been eaten and egested by the Asian palm civet. They harvest the coffee beans from the fecal matter of the civet (an asian big cat) and .... I stopped listening after hearing that and worked really hard not to laugh at Walter, the very nice and serious manager of Lola Coffee. He says its a delicacy people are willing to pay for. If you're interested he said to ask for the cat coffee. Good luck! The new Lola Coffee at the Yard is very nice.

My 16 oz. drip coffee was the absolute worst coffee. I would rather the usual burnt Starbucks sub-par cup over what I had today. (3 packets of Sugar in the Raw, honey and cream barely masked the taste.) To begin with, it was lukewarm. Second, it was the most sour coffee I'd ever tasted. This means that they have no idea how to properly use their 3-foot drip coffee contraption. Sour coffee happens when the grounds are over-soaked/concentrated. Their filter was looking really nasty, as the entire thing was super brown from being soaked for too long. You generally want to leave a little bit of the filter untouched to know that you haven't overdone it. The coffee crumble cake was so hard, I nearly broke my fork trying to eat it. At one point, I had to hold the fork with one hand while I hit the end of the utensil with my other hand, much like a chisel and stone. I do love the decor and location of the establishment. However, I would say that this restaurant is merely imitating the coffee culture in Denver/San Francisco without actually having the credentials or ability to deliver on the same quality.",images/stars-1.png

How exciting to see Lola's has reopened in The Yard on North 7th Street! Our party of three had no problem with reservation, parking or seating. Service was attentive and excellent. The tapas were outstanding! My favorite was the gambas (shrimp) pil-pil. We also shared a thin sliced filet mignon, chicken breast in tomato sauce, and jamon serrano with Manchego cheese. The prices were very reasonable, and the fun and games atmosphere of The Yard served as an entertaining background. I will definitely return to Lola's.",images/stars-5.png

First of all, so many new employees made our visit difficult because they're answers to our questions conflicted each other. We were seated and waited for approximately 13 minutes before the person that seated us had to take our order for drinks because everyone else was busy and keep in mind, the place was about a 1/3 rd full (remember new employees, we know because we asked). After our drinks were finally served our waiter took our order for appetizers because our party was still deciding for our main course. After a total of 30 minutes, we had been served our drinks and appetizers only to find out when they took our final order, they were out of Prime Rib which two in our party had their hearts set on! I then approached the manager and asked, ""How can you be out of Prime Rib, it's only 7 o'clock and it's Saturday""?! He proceeded to tell me that there is a disclosure on the menu that states ""availability is subject to change"". I said well after waiting 30 minutes where they finally took our order, don't you think we should've been told that when we entered""? He then said he would look into that, are you kidding me, he didn't give a shit! After 55 minutes upon entering we were served our main course to another disappointment! My wife's $30 dollar Rib Eye was tough, my Rib eye and baked potato was cold! We sent ours back and told them to take it off my bill cause I was so done with all their bullshit!

There was nine of us altogether, we have eaten here A few times in the past. Food is always top notch, however,We have never had exceptional service. I was a little excited when our server introduced herself and the gentleman training with her. Wow! I thought they're not busy and with two of them serving us How can we not get great service!? Sadly, I was hugely mistaken. I almost hate paying for drinks, when they're free refills but your server or helper are not around to get those refills for you. After our two appetizers were dropped off about 10 minutes later, she came to ask how the appetizer was and I told her great! We just need something to wash it down. Out of nine of us, nobody had anything left to drink. And then the concept of clearing plates/dishes was never considered. We just kept making piles in the middle the table. When the meals were dropped off my son was notified at that moment that they were out of sweet potatoes. Really! At 1 o'clock on Easter Sunday! Like, you don't know this when you put the order in a half hour ago?Never came back to check how steaks were prepared, My Mom's was supposed to be medium rare and it was medium well but it took so long to get somebody over there that we just had hers boxed up to go. Believe we saw the manager doing a couple laps around the restaurant stopping at other tables, never stopped at ours, or came over to apologize about the first well-done steak and bring my mom her second and suggest that she cut into it to make sure it's prepared correctly like we've seen other steakhouses do. I understand steaks/fillets can be hit or miss, but service should never be! Especially from the so-called management. Very disappointed. Server told us they were super busy and they were understaffed in the kitchen and in the waitstaff. There were several empty tables around us and throughout the restaurant. Poor thing, I don't know how she would handle it if they were truly ""super busy ""will not be returning. Going back next-door to Texas roadhouse!",images/stars-1.png

She did grab a napkin to dry it off but then, promptly left without waiting for us to sit down, hand us our menus or even tell us anything. Andrew was our waiter. He never offered us the complimentary bread & we had to ask for it. I had requested lemon in my water & had to ask twice more for the lemon. I chose a garden salad, while my husband chose a Caesar Salad: my salad was served but, we had to ask for my husband's. I ordered my filet medium rare & it was well done. Cedric, the manager that night, did bring me a second steak AND took the cost off of our tab. However, the second filet was RARE, thus undercooked. We have never had such a poor experience here & tend to think of Longhorn as better quality than some other restaurants. Greatly disappointed. Although Cedric tried to make it right, the whole dinner was terrible. I know that employee's will perform up to, or beneath, what management expects & requires. From the hostess to the server to the chef.... perhaps Cedric isn't requiring quality? ? Oh, BTW, when I mentioned that had asked for lemon in my water, the server blamed the bartender.

My ribeye was good, not great the X server offered steak sauce and I probably should have taken it. I ordered it medium and it came perfectly done but was not as tender as most ribeye steaks I've had this was closer to a top sirloin or low end choice.

We ordered our fav. the ribeye with some sides. Kiddo ordered ribeye as well. Our waiter was either tired or annoyed by us asking questions to the point he rolled his eye when walking away after I asked him how the sides worked here at LongHorn. Now, I understand LongHorn is a big chain restaurant but some of us are first timers ya know. Anywho, maybe it was just my waiter who seemed bothered by my question asking along with my pooped face from work all day mixed with his emotions and tiredness just didn't mix that day.

My expectations were not met, but maybe there were too high. First the good. The food. That is what is most important after all I guess. I ordered the Filet Kabobs and was very pleased. Be aware the steak is served well done as a default which is rather strange, and the waitress did not prompt to ask how I wanted it cooked. So be sure you mention it if you don't want well; I chose medium and ended up quite happy. The steak is served off the skewer with large chunks of grilled vegetables (i.e., onions, green peppers, etc). That all comes served on Louisiana rice or whatever side you want. I also enjoyed the ambiance and found it very classy and comfortable. Now for the odd. I was expecting J. Alexander to behave as a higher class chain. Our waitress wasn't the best though. She would refrain from interacting with us for long periods of time even walking past the table, but not stopping by. When she did stop to check on the food - which we had begun to eat already - she asked how the food - looked - not how it tasted and then said something like it will taste even better. Just odd. At the conclusion of the meal we were never offered dessert. We asked for coffees when she cleared the dinner plates away, which would have been a logical time to offer dessert, but she did not. People love the place though, there was a lobby full of people waiting for a seat. Definitely use OpenTable if you want to eat here. I will try it again sometime. I think with a different server my rating might increase.",images/stars-3.png

Alexander's,http://mlg.ucd.ie/modules/yalp/reviews_PjNMZ_4KhfdxYhQvuORkhg.html,negative,0,"I ate here with my boyfriend and future in-laws to celebrate his cousin's graduation. I was a fan of the decor and general layout of the place. Seeing the kitchen and the chefs running around reminded me of Hell's Kitchen (sans Gordon Ramsay yelling at everyone). It was dim and had a romantic atmosphere, each table boasting a lit candle. Service was generally good as the waitstaff was attentive, though our waiter wasn't the friendliest. It was a busy evening and he was probably tired, so I can't necessarily blame him for not being talkative. I'm really fond of restaurants that give you a jug of water for your table instead of the waiter constantly refilling it with a pitcher. Our jug was shaped like an old fashioned glass milk bottle, which I found amusing. I ordered the rotisserie chicken with a side of mashed potatoes. The meat was rather tender and the broth you're given on the side really does a wonderful job at making it super juicy. I also appreciated that it wasn't fatty and dark. However, I found the skin to be rather peppery. My boyfriend got the steak (the one he got in particular escapes me), french fries, and a croissant. When I sampled each item from his plate, my feelings were mixed. The steak tasted more like a ham, the french fries were reminiscent of the frozen shoestring fries I'd bake at home, and the croissant oddly enough tasted like a doughnut. Now, I'm no expert in French cuisine but I've always imagined a croissant being more akin to a dinner roll than a breakfast pastry. Yet again, maybe I've just been eating croissants wrong my whole life. On a similar note, I also sampled his Alex's side salad. I was turned off by the amount of shredded carrots and the like and the fact that the ranch dressing was at the bottom of the salad, and I found the croutons to also taste like some sort of sweet fried dough. Yet again, I like my salads plain and covered in cheese so who am I to judge? Overall, I wasn't too terribly disappointed with J. Alexander's. I couldn't say that I was a fan of every food I tried nor the borderline obscene prices, but it's not a bad place for a special occasion. I'd come back if I had the money and the means to come back to the Lyndhurst area, but it's not on my priority list.",images/stars-3.png

The service is good, the menu is pretty nice for this class of chain, the atmosphere is cozy, and the food I've experienced lately has been adequate. That said, I am one of the folks who came here back in the day when memories of a particular dish, or even side dish, prompted frequent return visits. Not so much any more, although I've heard dessert favorites like the carrot cake have endured. BTW what has two thumbs and doesn't like carrot cake... But this spot is way too out of the way to be a ""go to"" for dessert. And with a price point higher than an Applebee's, Friday's, or Carraba's, and food less impressive than your similarly priced, favorite steak, seafood or Italian spot, experienced diners, I feel, will feel short changed by the experience. Now with many options, I did pick this place to go on my birthday this year. But I think it was the nostalgia and the hope that things had changed once again...for the better.

Was that you that I heard beckoning pale little me, from across the street at lunch today? Well, here's my answer. Small, cute cafe/sandwich outfit, with a petite patio (yes, it's that small) out front. Service today was exceedingly friendly. As in, we're lonely, come and see us! Have a panini! No, come back! Pleeaassse! Which, I suppose is better than the gate keeper reception I've received at other, lesser, establishments. I found the menu to be bit busy. The lettering in the menu board, as with the tiny take away menus is really small. It's as if you should already know what you are about to order before you walk in to receive your excess greeting. Ok, ok, ok. What did I eat? Soup and half panini lunch special. I enjoyed the Woodbridge Panini and a side if a lemon basil basmati soup. The panini was neatly pressed, with a good sluce of provolone, some salami, and I think, ham. You have a choice of bread- I just guessed, and announced 'olive'. What else is available? I have no idea. Note: mini script on the menu. The soup was light and lemony, without being too tart, but was lacking the promised basmati rice. A few spare grains were tossed in, but looked lonely, swimming about the bottom of the bowl. However, for a tidy $8, I say, not bad.",images/stars-3.png

Came on a sunny Saturday around 1:30 pm. The place is small, casual and one of those that was converted from a Victorian house. It wasn't very busy at the time. Not sure if there's another patio in the back but we took seats in the front patio, which was small, only seat 2 pairs. But it was nice as it was under a tree and next to small flower beds and you some people watching as they come along the sidewalk on this quiet street. The daily special panini that day, which was pulled pork panini, was sold out at the time, so we just order straight from the menu. We got a steak panini and a salmon panini. Each plate came with 2 olives and a simple vinigrette salad on the side. We enjoyed our paninis. Tasty and the breads were toasted to perfection. We had our paninis with olive breads, as oppose to white or wholewheat, which I thought was a more special choice and more flavorful. The salads were also quite good. I wasn't sure if it was balsamic as I normally don't like balsamic because of the smell. But I find the smell for this one not at all repulsive. Overall, this is a nice little joint for a small casual meal. They had cakes/desserts and coffees, but we didn't get any during this visit so I can't judge those. The thing I do like most is the service. The owner Raj was an attentive and jolly fellow. He served us personally and informed us with details of their specials. He was also very apologetic for not being able to provide the daily special panini as they were sold out of the pulled pork. By the time we were ready for the bill, the owner wasn't around and the girl that attended to us was also quite friendly. We tipped 20% and will definitely come back again.",images/stars-4.png

Bizarre but not really as it's at the extreme border close to the Art Gallery of Ontario. Just a block north. We split two paninis, one with chicken breast and brie the other was a turkey with tomato. Too bad they weren't grilled on the outside like one's at Cafe Supreme but the taste was alright. Nice atmosphere, cute ceiling bulbs and chandelier, wood floors, chalk written menus, restaurant is in one of the converted standard Victorian 3 story row houses so it's got character.

You can add a salad and there are so many to choose from: chick pea salad, mushrooms, tomato/bocconcini, etc. Soups are also great in the winter. I also recommend their arangini (italian-style risotto ball, fried and served with tomato sauce -- amazing!).

It wasn't cooked in the style of chicken parmesan at all.

It took them two hours to bring our food out. They were short staffed and very unprofessional. Our waitress had another person to help her, but they pulled her to another table to help out the group who were seated next to us. Why? I don't know. Mind you, they received their food before us and all of their orders were correct. When our food finally came out, half of the orders were incorrect, and some didn't receive their meals at all. The person who planned the gathering had to go to the kitchen to check on her order?! Is that not ridiculous?!! We asked to speak to the manager two different times, but she never came to check on the issue. A person from our table had to get up to go look for her and overheard her say, ""I don't care"" to one of the waitresses. That was icing on the cake. We were treated like crap from the start.

This was flat out tomato soup (with that weird creamy orange color and no seasoning) with some crumbly lumps of undefined meat. My son got the Veal house special....let's just say...no. NO.

We first ordered a Mango Lassi that tasted great, so we had high expectations for the rest of the meal. We ordered the 2 person meat dish which included Chicken tikka masala, lamb curry and tandoori chicken along with naan and golubjamon(an Indian dessert) all for $40. The naan was good but the curries were terrible. They all tasted overly sweet and were a little too watery. Ive had these dishes at many other restaurants and ive never had them taste sweet before. I dont know if it was an off night for the chef or if that is how they normally taste. The tandoori chicken was even too sweet. None of the dishes had that pop of flavor that Indian/Nepali food usually has, it just tasted like sweet mush that was missing flavor. We had a lot of left to overs to take home but we gave them to some homeless people on the capital square as we walked to our car. The golubjamon wasn't good either. Needless to say, my wife and I wont go back to this establishment, I would not reccommend this restaurant for the curries, just the naan and the mango lassi.",images/stars-2.png

This time our service was polite and attentive. Of course, we had the place to ourselves. But the server was pleasant and quick with the refills. The food: overall good flavors. Small dishes for the price, though. Our bill was about $50 for two lassi (drinks), one order of aloo naan ($2.95), and two masala dishes (lamb and vegetable). There wasn't really enough to take home from either of our dishes, and they could have been more generous with the vegetables. But the flavors were there.

And it wasn't good. The dough on our momo was chewy and the naan was like trying to rip off a piece of cartilage. The curries were all watery. I was so upset I just spent $90 on that!

The owner helped us out with the menu and suggested I try the bun bo beef noodle. I figured might as well since that's typically what I order at any pho restaurant. First taste and I knew I needed to come back for more sooner rather than later. It was slightly different than other bun bo flavoured broths I've tried; more flavourful. It didn't taste like a soup seasoning that was pulled off a grocery store shelf. About a year later, (shame on me for not coming back sooner) I'm returning for lunch. They've come out with a pho challenge! $50, 50mins, 6lbs of noodles and meat. Finish it all by yourself and the bowl of noodles is free and you get a $100 gift card for the restaurant. This visit, I ordered the same bun bo beef noodles! The broth was a little different from my first visit; it had lost the unique flavour I thought I had picked out the first time. BUT, it's not a complaint. It was still delicious and satisfied my pho craving. The two pieces of pork hock was SO tender, fall off the bone. Didn't even know pork hock could be so tender. I also got to try my friend's satay broth. Delicious! Peanuty, slightly coconut, with a touch of sweetness. I always seem to think of Mr. Pho first when I'm craving. Will definitely be back soon.

When you are here, get ready for a pho chow down! Note: There are plenty of parking spots at the back when you drive past the restaurant. The front can get a bit chaotic at times lol. This local spot first attracted me NOT because of the Pho Challenge but for the recommendation of the Bun Bo Hue aka Vietnamese Spicy Beef Noodle Soup, and the hubby REALLY wants to come try. I'm not exactly a fan of spicy food, but the picky hubby seemed to have really enjoyed it, so it is definitely a pass :) The Vietnamese style cold coffee was also very, very good... but it certainly does takes time to make. WARNING: You may expect the coffee to come after your meal. The food IMO are delicious and very satisfying. Other than pho and vermicelli, I also love all rice dishes at a pho restaurant lol. My favourite dish at Mr. Pho is the Hainanese Chicken Rice! The flavoured rice is delicious and not oily, and the chicken is tender and juicy. I would order this again! The service from the owner is always warm, friendly and welcoming :) Definitely points right there! The owner must also be an anime/manga fanatic because of all the beautiful collector figurines displayed in the restaurant! They are not for sale (We asked lol) There are even some creative DIYs, and they look really awesome... I especially love the Goku holding up the bowl of pho lol. Overall, a good local spot to grab some pho! Challenge to finish the 6 lbs. House Special pho under 50 minutes by yourself, and it is on the house (value $50)!

Upon seeing the ginormous challenge bowl sitting on their counter, we realized we were understaffed to take it on. It's massive! We opted for their pho, satay noodles, and vermicelli. All of them came in good time and all were really good. My husband got the large bowl of pho and a small would have been more than enough. The serving sizes are pretty big. I got the vermicelli and the spring roll that came with it was really delicious; super crunchy with a pretty good filling. Our friends that got the satay noodles were also happy with their food. I was surprised to see it come out bright yellow, since I'm used to seeing reddish satay noodles, but the flavours were really good. Our waters were constantly refilled the owner served us. He was happy to talk to us about his eclectic collection of Funko Pops and Gundams that line his walks and his travels to Japan.

I couldn't stop eating though my lips were burning and were swelling a little bit. I could finish the whole bowl with just the plain noodles or even just the soup. At the end of it, I drank all the soup in the bowl of noodle. It tasted awesome! Next time, I would want to come back for the Hainanese Chicken with Rice.

This place is a gem and I'm so mad about not knowing about this place earlier. I was craving pho so my boyfriend looked up places to go and Mr.Pho was close and had good reviews so we just went for it. The place was bit hard to find in the winter evening. I'm not familiar with the plaza itself so my boyfriend and I were like staring down each store to read the name (noobs). But the Mr.Pho is located in the corner right next to the extended parking lot section. The owner even set up his own flashing lights to light up the place in the dark! It's a small pho place, seats about 10 tables. We came in around 6:30 on a friday and there was one other person eating. Seated and greeted immediately. We ordered the rice paper pork spring rolls, rare beef with tendon pho, and my boyfriend tried the satay beef in a spicy soup. The portions of everything is massive! Which I was really surprised about. I know pho tends to be in a big bowl but the size here really outdid itself! The regular was like a large in other places! I got the regular and my boyfriend got the large. The large was just something else. even the spring rolls were huge! I expected the regular size ones all the other pho places give. No, these spring rolls were huge I had to use two hands to hold it to avoid any spillage! The spring rolls were packed full of stuff and it did not lack in the meat portion, everything was just right. If you like spicy definitely try the Satay Beef it's a specialty there and the owner was raving about it. The owner himself was wonderful. He speaks perfect English and Chinese and he is willing to accommodate you in any way. You can tell he really cares about the food and wants his customers to be happy! If something says there are peanuts in it, he said he can remove it for you if you let them know ahead! He came back to fill water several times which is rare to find in a lot of restaurants nowadays (I don't know why). Even when he brought our food out he would help rearrange our table to put the food down and avoid any spillage onto our stuff. He was so considerate and sweet.",images/stars-5.png

Lots of pho places in Richmondhill/Markham are less than average. Coming originally from North York where there are a bunch Vietnamese owned Pho places, I do know what a good bowl of pho taste. I didn't have the common beef rice noodle (since I'm accustomed to my mother's), but I had their grilled chicken w/rice, spring rolls and their special Thai rice noodle soup. Their large size for noodles are huge and very generous with toppings and noodles. It was only $11 and it can honestly feed two people. The taste was very flavourful, meat was tender and noodles were of good quality. My rice didn't look appealing at first, but honestly, the spring roll and chicken that came with was pretty good so I'm not complaining. I can tell that the chef makes sure that each dish will be flavourful. Will be back to try other items on the menu! The one star less is because for the price of the rice dish, you would get a steamed egg or shrimp cane or shredded pork along with it.",images/stars-4.png

Reason? Well.. I've had the bun bo hue twice and the thai style house special beef noodle soup twice and I have realized that these soups are a hit or miss! I've had one great experience with each..then the next the soup will be extremely spicy or extremely oily... I also ordered the roti & curry sauce and it was extremely pathetic. The roti was two paper-thin pieces of (probably) frozen and purchased at T&T roti... it was very bland and...SMALL. The curry was even sadder... it was in the size of those soy sauce/ketchup dishes.. and it was really, really salty. For just over $5 I expected something half decent.. or maybe at least a bigger (less concentrated) portion of curry sauce? I think I've tried this place enough for a fair review and sadly will not be returning.",images/stars-2.png

Because of this, my boyfriend and I decided to share a large pho with wings and spring rolls. All the noodles and meat fit in the two side bowls after one serving, so we decided to get the XL instead the following week. Even with the XL - it was just a huge bowl with lots of soup and everything fit into the same 2 side bowls yet again. That was very disappointing. This is run by Chinese - not Viet - but they make it pretty well. The soup is good and doesn't make you feel thirsty afterwards. The fried spring rolls aren't the typical ones from the viet restaurants- they use a different wrapping? The owner is really nice... however sort of defensive. I took a sip of my viet iced milk coffee and told my boyfriend it didn't taste right (it came in that drip coffee and everything). Then the owner heard me and came over and asked if I wanted one remade which was nice, but starts explaining that the reason might be because the coffee might have had too much water? I wanted to tell him that it's because I don't taste the condense milk- it tasted like it was mixed with milk and sugar but I didn't get a chance to speak, and I didn't want another coffee. He gave us 10% off. This place gets the job done if you can't find anywhere else but it's not ""authentic"" and there's definitely way more soup than noodles and beef.",images/stars-3.png

Upon telling staff about how their soup lacked flavour - (saying it very nicely, not expecting anything in return, only to tell them what they are serving their customers), they started attacking us, telling us a lacklustre excuse of if we had come 30 minutes later, the soup would taste better if it was boiled longer. Essentially, they told us that it was our fault for not coming at a suitable time to have their soup at a good state. The lady there continued to say ""some people like it bland and some like it salty, I can't just add salt to the whole pot"". She completely missed the point, IT WAS THE SOUP ITSELF, THE FLAVOUR OF THE BEEF, NOT THE SALTINESS. I would give this place 0 stars if i could. They were arguing back to us. Completely unprofessional and so rude. If your dish is not up to par, DON'T TAKE ORDERS AND PUT OUT FOOD. It is not up to the customer to just come at the perfect moment to have what they expect. Do I have to call them up and ask beforehand if their soup is good? This is a restaurant, you are supposed to be prepared for the dinner rush! Terrible service.

Lacking in complexity and flavour, I would best describe the soup as single dimensional; the addition of sriracha and hoisin bringing it to two. The texture of the noodles was ""just done"" with some obvious bite to it, but not enough to be unpleasurable. Yet credit must be given where credit is due, and so my compliments on the tripe and tendon which were cooked with authority, yielding easily with every bite.

The menu seems to lean a bit more towards Vietnamese food with a fusion twist of Chinese. I can't say it's the most authentic I had, but it's tasty in its own way. There are the traditional pho dishes, which was lacking a bit in flavor. It was missing that star anise flavor. There are also a variety of appetizers, fried rice, vermicelli to name a few. We tried the roti and it was quite tasty. A bit oily, but generally light and flaky, with a bit of curry and pickled veggies. While the pho seemed to lack a bit of flavor, it was still very decent, portion size was also very generous and they didn't skimp on the meat. It was very satisfying over all. My other half got a satay curry based soup, which had a nice after taste of coconut. The service and people were very friendly, welcoming and chatty. Food came out quick and hot, decently tasty with good portion sizes, and a fair price (starts at $8.50). Tough to fault a place that is fairly priced, decently tasty with generous portions.

We were warned that the large pho is huge, and no kidding... it was HUGE, they're very generous with the portions even the beef (which usually gets skimped). The beef broth is not light and comes in a darker tone. I liked it but for my mom, she thought it was kind of heavy and a bit salty - so it's personal preference? The noodles were chewy, and the beef was good. They know how to make a good pho! Although the menu has 'set' pho combinations, the waiter told us to let him know of the desired combination and it can be done. No extra charge! The chicken vermicelli came with a spring roll which was extremely crispy! Again, the portion was really generous, almost spilling out of the bowl it come in. The chicken wings were standard fried wings, but no flavouring... when it was supposed to be Vietnamese style wings. It came in a basket of 5wings for $6.25 which I do not think it's worth...

My brother-in-law got the House Special Pho which comes with way more beef and other cuts and he really liked it. I shared the Chicken and Pork with Rice and the Vermicelli with Pork. The flavours were actually quite decent/satisfactory, but I thought the presentation of both dishes was lacking (not enough pickled carrots, cucumbers, etc). I also found that the Chicken+Pork in the rice dish was TOO salty (and it kinda had that ""glaze""/oily colour on it, kinda like that colour you get when you go korean BBQ and you haven't changed the grill in awhile, you know what I mean?!). The vermicelli with pork had plenty of meat and noodles, but I felt it was lacking some veggies. I also didn't like the wrapper the spring rolls were made with; they used the ""smooth"" kind that you find in Dim Sum Spring rolls (instead of the bumpy ones that I normally see at Vietnamese restaurants), although the filling was more traditional.

It's a quaint little restaurant nestled at the end of a strip plaza which has plentiful parking. Simple decor is what you first notice when you enter the restaurant. Then the delicious smell of the beef broth simmering in the kitchen hits your senses and you know this place is serves the real deal. Confirmation comes when my pho is served piping hot and packed with flavour. I was quite impressed with the generous amount of meat and the fresh noodles they used. I ordered their Vietnamese drop coffee over ice AND they threw in complimentary chicken wings that were enormous! Fully satisfied at this point, I ordered their Hainanese chicken rice to go and I enjoyed that for dinner. The portions are huge and good is priced right. Good food is important, however service cannot be overlooked!!! The owners of this restaurant are friendly (can be humourous at times); which made my visit memorable. I will definitely be returning!!!",images/stars-5.png

I'm a huge fried chicken but Nando's has made me fall equally in love with grilled chicken because it tastes so great here. The chicken sandwich is highly underrated, I don't see many people get the sandwich but it tastes great (especially with their sauces) and the chicken is juicy and tender. My other favourites are the 1/4 chicken and 1/2 chicken (extra hot) and I can always count on those to hit the spot. They also have a great variety of sides, my favourites being the corn and peri-peri fries. Can never go wrong with a cheeky Nando's.",images/stars-5.png

Garlic bread is also rather impressive, I know you're probably thinking it's hard to get that wrong, but you'd be surprised. If you're hungry, I recommend the half chicken with mashed potatoes. The mash is not overly salty and has a pretty even consistency. 4 stars because they changed the rice a few years back and I still haven't gotten over it.",images/stars-4.png

With a big group we always get the 1/4 chicken (leg and thigh) lemon herb with the Portuguese garlic bread, Casa salad with oil and vinegar and spiced rice. We order and pay at the cashier then they deliver the food to our table. The chicken has always been hot, juicy and flavorful while the sides complemented the chicken well in taste and freshness. Eating here with my hubby we ordered the 1/2 chicken (which was actually two 1/4 chickens) with lemon herb which was a little on the dry side but still tasty. For the sides we had the appetizer platter with the roasted red pepper dip which came with pita, 3 grilled wings (tender and juicy) and the Portuguese garlic bread. The red pepper dip was salty but the garlic bread which was grilled was delicious. The bread was even better when dipped in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. TIPS: Come with a large group If you come with a small group order the 1/4 chicken (leg and thigh) or wings to make sure your chicken is not dried out. For sides, get the grilled Portuguese garlic bread (make sure to dip it in some oil and vinegar), Casa salad with oil and vinegar and spiced rice.",images/stars-4.png

Food was very tasty and I really liked how you get the whole wing and not just the little halves. Also really enjoyed that our corn was still on the cob. I was very full after, even though we shared. The girl (different from the cashier) who brought our food said she'd return with our waters in a moment, but never came back. And you NEED water when you're having spicy food !

Get the garlic ""heat"" and it's great. The food is good. I've only had one bad incident where I ordered my usual 1/4 chicken breast/wing combo and everyone at my table was served while I was waiting for my plate. After 5 minutes, I went up and asked and they said ""oh, we missed your order, we'll make it right away"". So I waited, very hungry at this point. My friends didn't want to start without me. When I finally got my plate, I hungrily ate everything quickly. Then I noticed they gave me 1/4 chicken (leg and thigh combo). By that time, I had already all everything so I couldn't argue. I went up and told them they delayed my order and messed it up. They didn't even apologize! Anyway, I would suggest going to Churasso Villa just a couple blocks away! I heard it's really good.

My favourite dish is the chicken liver with a Portuguese bun. Try it, you won't be disappointed. General observations: Order and pay at the counter. No biggie I suppose, but I always find it odd when the credit card machine asks how much tip you want to add, when they've actually haven't done anything for you yet.

Like one reviewer mentioned, it does continue to burn after. :) It's kind of interesting to note that they get you to pay for the meal before you sit down with your number at a table and there's an option to tip on the machine (if you're paying by any kind of card). Not quite sure why they have it set up this way... how do I know what I'm going to tip if they haven't served me the food yet?? All of that being said, their service is decent so I don't have issues leaving a pre-tip. (Oh, but on that note, why the heck is tip calculated as a percentage of the meal??? In my books, service is service, regardless of how expensive the meal is. I wish the practice of tipping with set dollar amounts would take hold vs a percentage of the meal. Would you tip a valet more or less depending on the venue or the cost of your meal? Ridiculous.)

I don't even know...) but I need to find them and thank them profusely. This place is the best and most authentic Thai food in North Las Vegas or away from The Strip that I have found so far. We had Thai visitors with us and took them here, and if they called it authentic, I'll take their word for it. Now on to the food. I'm going to skip past the Pad Thai, Fried Rice, and Thai Iced Tea, because 1) we all know it's delicious and 2) they do it just as delicious. Some of my personal favorites: Fried Pork Belly & Rice: Simple dish, exactly as it sounds, with a few dipping options but honestly it's pretty damn good 'au naturel!' The pork belly is a really balanced mix of meat with the richness of the fat of that area, so don't think of bacon or pulled pork - this is unique in itself and SO good. It has a perfect combination of thick crunch, chew (both meaty and fatty), and the melty-in-your-mouth richness that animal fat does. Couple that with rice as your level base, and you've got a pretty darn good meal right there. Mango Sticky Rice: Anyone that hasn't tried this yet needs to go find some, NOW. This is a uniquely Asian dish (to my knowledge), using short grain rice, soaked overnight (the actual process escapes me), steamed, sweetened with coconut milk or something.. and then you add ripe mango with that and sweet milk (condensed milk? coconut milk? sorry guys, culinary fail today) but regardless, the tangy sweetness of the fruit with the bulk and chew and more subtle and level sweetness of the rice - it's really divine. Oh, and the rice really is quite sticky; don't try to cut through this with cheap plastic cutlery - it's not going to work. Give these guys a try. The staff, food, and service are authentic to Thai values, and I'm just beyond glad they are within such a close proximity to work.",images/stars-5.png

Usually the service is great and the food is good. Today however was not one of those days. I walk in see there's no tables so I politely sit down and wait my turn. Couple of minutes later a family walks in. They get seated before me after I waited for 10 minutes. The server acknowledges me and ask me if I want a water while I wait. I'm annoyed but thankful that he asked if I needed anything while waiting. I tell him I'm good and I'll wait, thank you. After 16 more minutes of waiting they seated another group before me. The server came up to me at this point because I'm sure he could tell I'm furious and he said it'll be just awhile longer...I told him I'm good and left. I'm so disappointed with this place I understand it's more money to seat a group with four people versus just seating one individual but come on twice in a row. : Update: 2-20-18 I'm updating my review after I went in today for a pickup. The server was there that I had seen my last visit and I have never seen anyone so apologetic from my last visit! Definitely made me feel like they meant it! It's rare for company's to go out of their way to make sure you come back again! Plus my curry was delicious!! Thank you",images/stars-5.png

They put a lot of details and thoughts to not only the interiors, but also the food. We ordered fried garlic rice, a side of cucumber salad, chicken satay, pad see ew, steamed chicken with ginger rice, and garlic chicken rice plate. I can literally eat pots and pots of their fried garlic rice. It is soooooo amazing yet super simple. It packs so much flavor. Even the baby loved the rice. The cucumber salad was delicious and well dressed. Just everything was well seasoned and scrumptious. I definitely ate sooo much that I had no choice but to take food home.

This Thai restaurant was good and I'm glad that I didn't judge a book by its cover this time lol. It's not located in the safest area of Craig Road, but it's right across from the military housing if that makes you feel better lol. Parking is small but you can park in front of the restaurant closer to the car wash. When you walk in the place is surprisingly clean and cozy with modern decor. The menu is extensive, they have a lot of good choices. We ordered -combo pad see eu -chicken pad Thai -thai tea -garlic rice -beef jerky -chicken satay Everything was delicious! The Thai tea was the best, made nicely and not too sweet for my taste. For apps we had the garlic rice, beef jerky, and chicken satay. I would come here just to order the garlic rice, it's my favorite thing ever and I could eat a whole bowl of it (no raaaagrets). Also doesn't hurt that it's just as good as Nittaya's garlic rice except for half of the price ($3.95 for a bowl at Narong's). I enjoyed the beef jerky it was chewy (not in a bad way) and flavorful. I didn't have a lot of the chicken satay but my friends said it was good. They use a chunky dipping sauce for it here, and the cucumber salad it comes with is refreshing. For entrees we shared the pad thai and pad see eu. They were both good! I usually never order pad see eu because it is too sweet of an entree for me, but theirs was not that sweet. I liked the way the cooked their noodles too. The pad thai was good I got a level 4/10 and it had a good kick to it. We were too full for dessert but next time I'll make sure to have room. Would definitely recommend this place, especially if you live in North Las Vegas because it's hard to find good food places around here!",images/stars-5.png

The service was very quick, we ordered our food and within less than 10 minutes they had our orders hot and ready. I ordered the chicken pad Thai, it had a bit of sweetness that was balanced out with savory chicken. There was enough food for me to get full at lunch and save half of it for lunch the next day.

We were browsing yelp and saw that they just opened up. Went to order a bunch of food from yelp 24 and our food was ready in 20 mins. Upon arrival to the restaurant, we noticed that we forgot to order some dessert so we added two boba tea. They were so nice to give it to us for free since we ordered a lot. Servings are pretty huge. Come here hungry or just come and have a lot of leftovers for the next few days. My personal favorite is the duck curry - Authentic taste and very delicious. The staff are very friendly and they make you feel comfortable like you are in your home eating your mom's cooking. They asked us where we're from, where we live and we told them that we live on base which basically is across the street. They said that they will deliver up to the gate (since they can't come in on base) and that makes it easier and faster to get food. Just call them and tell them to deliver your food in front of the gate and they'll be more than happy to deliver it to you warm and fresh. This will definitely be our hang out / late night craving, getting sober spot.! Highly recommended.",images/stars-5.png

So, I went to support the newest restaurant in this space, Nest. A couple of friends of mine held a small networking event here, and the only patrons in the restaurant at the time were the 10-15 of us who attended the event. I heard from a few people that arrived before me that they all ordered fries and had to wait a while because the chef had not arrived yet. I ordered a drink and was told they couldn't make the one I requested because they didn't have all of the ingredients. I ordered a different one, and the bartender made it exactly the way I liked it. She was very friendly. I was starving, so I ordered the chicken wings. Although, I felt they were a bit overpriced at $15. 4 other patrons ordered shrimp and grits and we played an ice breaker game for about 30- 35 mins. During the game, we had to request that the air conditioning be turned on because it was so hot and everyone was sweating. After we finished the game, we realized we still did not have our food. They went to go check, and came out with the shrimp dishes. Then I was told that ""THERE WAS AN ERROR WITH THE CHICKEN"" so I would have to order something else. What does that even mean? If I was unable to get the chicken, why was I not told that almost 40 minutes before when I made my order for the chicken wings? Being that I was starving and it took so long to get the original orders, I chose not to believe that it would only take 10 minutes to prepare anything else. There was barely an apology, and I was told they couldn't even comp my one drink for the inconvenience. I left and went to Morton's. I wish that I could say how the food was, but I never received any. My hope for them is that they will get better service, better customer service, and not end up like all of the previous businesses that have occupied this space.",images/stars-1.png

Our first visit we were celebrating our daughters birthday the place was empty and the food was mediocre. Our server had said maybe 4 words to us the whole time never offerd any type of specials or walk us thru the menu. She did not at anytime check on us and after we sang happy birthday to our daughter she never even offerd any birthday deserts or even botherd to check on us... So today we went back to try again, boy that was a dumb idea!!!! Today it was daughter and I and i just looking for some lunch and we decided to give it a try again. We where sat with the same server from the first time we orders waters and a sprite and i orderd an iced coffee, i sent the coffee back because it tasted like it was 8 days old, again no personality from the server and i even apologized for her to have to take the coffee back, my daughter ordered the french toast and i orderd the tortilla soup. Our server shows up and slaps everthing on the table and walks away!!!! Guess what! The soup was cold and when i finally got her to come back over to our table she was aggravated that i did not want my cold soup!!! So i apologized again to her (should have been the other way around! !!!!) And i told her to please put in an order of steak and eggs med rare for me. While my daughter eats alone our server has disappeared and never checked on us. We waited for about 30 minutes with out drink refills and i finally flaged another person down to refill our waters.. guess who finally shows up? our server!! She slaps my steak and eggs down in front of me and walks away again... after waiting for 25 more minutes for her to return so i can tell her that i asked for med rare and not well done my daughter and I get up and walk to the counter and request for a manager. The manager ends up being our server!!!!!!! How... great.... yay!!! Had an attitude problem when I told her that I'm not paying for this entire experience except for the one thing we actually ate which was the French toast, she then insisted with an attitude oh it's okay I'll void the whole check! She then gave me an attitude when I told her no I would like to pay for the food that my daughter and I ate... she then rolled her eyes and walked away, the girl that was cashing us out at the podium was staring at me like I was speaking in ancient alien hieroglyphics, and was completely incompetent of not knowing what to do. I said you can ring me in for the French toast I would like to pay for that please since we did eat that and enjoyed it... after the hostess regains Consciousness and swipes my credit card for the French toast the manager comes over and has the audacity to yell at the Dazed and Confused creature for swiping me for the French toast. I again get into an argument with the manager and insisted that I will pay for the food we ate! we will never ever return to this establishment and that manager slash server slash whatever has the personality of a wet mop!!!!!!!

The tuna melt is now very bland and served with fries that look like they were the remnants from the bottom of frozen bag...meaning they were broken pieces of a potato.

We ordered the Tommy B omelette and 2 eggs benedicts. We hasked for crispy bacon in pmace of ham easy on the sauce. Well the headache begins no follow up service on coffee refills the bacon was not crispy sent back the eggs were nearly raw like a rush job and slothered in sauce. It seemed like they never remade the breakfast but added even more sauce to hide the fact. After being in the resturant for almost 1.5 hours sitting waiting on our order while other tables seated after us finished eating and left I think they lost our order in the shuffle and did not know until we said something then rushed the food out. Eggs uncooked fee liking like getting sick ? When we asked for the manager our server sent over another server guess she did not want to deal with us anymore she said he stepped out. She said we did not have to pay for the breakfast my husband said no we are not we are leaving she expected us to eat the raw eggs just because she said we did not have to pay for it.

The country fried steak had a nice light and crisp breading on the outside but was tender and so flavorful underneath the breading. The gravy was was just the right consistency of thickness and the flavor was on POINT! It came with two over-easy eggs cooked to perfection, which I happily dipped my perfect toasted wheat bread into. I love that there is never a wait no matter what day or time you show up. The servers are really nice and they take your order on an iphone. At first I was like, ""Is she TEXTING while taking our order!?? WTH!!"" but no, she was just being technologically savvy.

I decided to take some coworkers out to lunch here one day, we wound up back at work having eaten Taco Bell. First off it took the server 15 minutes to get us our menus. Then it took another 10 minutes just to get glasses of water. Finally after being there for a total of about 25 minutes I had to get up and ask the man standing at the front door if he could find someone to come over and take our order. After asking him to find someone to take our order, a disgruntled server came over and took all six of our orders. I explained to her that we were on a lunch break, and now barely had about 30 minutes to eat and get back to work. She assured me that the food would be coming very quickly. 25 minutes later we received our food. I was so upset I told her to forget it and to just bring us the bill for our drinks. She offered to wrap up our food so that we could take it to go! I explained to her that we intended on eating there, and were not planning on eating Mexican food in the car on our way back to work! She replied, extremely rudely, ""well I can't just let you have this food for free."" I told her I didn't expect any free food and wasn't planning on eating there ever again. My entire group wound up grabbing Taco Bell on the way back to work. I'm not sure if this place is under new management but, when I used to come here about six years ago, before the remodel, this place was amazing! They used to have the best, most authentic Mexican food in the valley what a shame. The man who I assumed was either the owner or the manager was completely useless. The waitstaff seems to run this place now and they are extremely rude! The attitude that I received from the server was such that I wouldn't touch their food with a 10 foot pole, as I have absolutely no guarantee that she didn't take my food back and spit in it. Before the remodel this place was so good! They used to have the most authentic green corn tamales, calabasitas, and the red chili sauce was absolutely incredible!!!!

I am always looking for a good Mexican place-- on a specific search for the best guac in greater Phoenix--, and one of my coworkers thought we should give it a try. The one good thing is the decor inside- it really is nice. Now on to the ""no bueno"" portion of our program... In summary, the food was bland, the food was cold, the service wasn't that great, and the salsa and the guacamole were just plain WEIRD. No need to overexplain bland and boring food (I had a chicken burrito, and I added cheese, rice, and sour cream), but I do want to point out that I ate GRISTLE in my chicken... which is what finally made me stop trying. Other items to note: 1. The server would barely glance at us, and when she came to ask for our order, she hadn't even asked for a drink order first. Also, we had to ask twice for more tortilla chips. I will say, though, that our main dishes came out fast... but mine was ice cold. 2. The flavor of the salsa was okay, but the texture was-- as another Yelper has described-- exactly like ketchup. Bizarre. 3. The guac. Oh the guac. Horrific. The first question was the pale green color. My friend and I spent at least 4 full minutes trying to figure out what one would mix with avocados to get that exact Lawrence Welk-era seafoam color. There was no onion, no peppers, no lime, NO flavor. After a few additional samplings (more out of morbid curiosity than anything), I came up with EGG. Yes, like hard-boiled egg whites.

Their chips and salsa were OK, pureed tomatoes, very spicy in little bottles. I ate so much of them because my food came out so late. The chairs were hard, it was a really large, empty restaurant with a somewhat bar-ish feel. Good to stop by if you're in the area but not worth a long trip.",images/stars-3.png

The appetizer I ordered was forgotten about and was comped by our server ( A Nice Touch ). The entrees arrived and received a mixed review from our group. A chicken salad that had no dressing ? A chicken taco salad that also appeared to be missing something, salsa maybe ? The tortilla bowl was limp and soggy. Whats with the guacamole ? looks like they cut it with sour cream. Also, our drinks went unfilled. The server was very rough around the edges, not very knowledgeable and seemed too busy to serve us properly. Overall. an average experience.

That's okay, because I got a bean and cheese burrito and was happy to see it not smothered in melted cheese and a ton of sauce. Although I'm sure you can get it that way if you'd like. The chips and 2 salsa's were delicious, service was fast for a busy lunch crowd. The inside looks really modern, without the cheap and cheesy looking mexican decor.

It's a massive dining hall now, a bit up-scale even, but with a sports bar atmosphere (given the huge wide-screen tv as the new centerpiece). There's now a separate bar area, and a patio area that looks pretty cool.

It's a nice place to go if you are going out on Queen Street for drinks after. I think it's a good place for groups, but the service is pretty bad.

The friendly atmosphere created by the long harvest table, and the simple yet sophisticated gasto-cuisine created the perfect meal. It was also a great cross section of people - the post-work office crowd, local artsies, and older clientele. At that first visit I had their Buffalo meatloaf which was truly bliss on that cold March night. Summer brunch at OF was also quite good - their Breakfast for Two was a tad spicy, and very large, but on a lazy Sunday, with a couple of cups of coffee's, it's a great way to spend an hour on. That being said, even though my first couple of visits were stellar, I recently went back to see that the restaurant may have lost its way. On this occasion, inspite of my reservation, I had to wait 20 minutes for my seats to free-up, and was also ushered out around the 1.5 hour mark even though we were still on our mains (the kitchen was EXTREMELY slow). The food was also average and unimpressive, which capped off some minor changes to their menu items (for the worse). I'm willing to give this place another chance, maybe on a less volatile evening (it was very busy, I'll give them that), but I really hope that they're not trying to rest on their laurels too much.",images/stars-3.png

Cool space with magnetic walls, a gorgeous hanging fireplace, a single long communal table, interesting menu ranging from vegan to carnivore and plaid plaid galore. As soon as I walked in I felt like I'd stumbled upon some sort of space/time warp and ended up in Williamsburg on Queen St. Unfortunately, as prefaced by the star rating...Oddfellows proved the old adage, ""Don't judge a book by it's cover."" The lovely Kat F. had made us reservations at 9pm and strolling in two minutes before I was greeted with the small space, a full table and little bar seats to wait in. The frazzled bartender cum waiter looked a bit horrified when we told him we were here for our 9pm reservation and he told us to ""sit back and have a drink, those two are just about to leave"". Ok. I asked for a Greyhound. He replied, ""What's a Greyhound?"" Alright, so this guy's not a bartender. Kat asks about their spiked lemonade and after rifling around in a dirty floor fridge for a bit he brings out a plastic jug of pink sludge and says, ""We have some...juice."" Ick. I ask about the grapefruit for the Greyhound and he comes up for air with another dubious jug of concentrate and I concede and ask for Hendrick's which he denies they have until I point out the bottle on the shelf. This whole scene at a dive bar? Fine acceptable. But it was pretty ludicrous at a restaurant that charges $25 an entree to be served something you'd drink at a house party at 4am when everyone stops caring that the juice is expired and who knows where the booze came from. After continuing to wait, the time crept to 9:35 and we decided to order our food so that when we were seated we'd dive right in. 9:50 came around and after watching a homeless crazy do a round poking at diners before being thrown out, the frazzled guy kicks out the couple nursing their empty beer glasses that had been busy trying to decide whose glasses are more ironic. He puts plates of food at the seats and as an afterthought says, ""Oh, yeah you guys can go sit down now if you want."" Thanks? I ordered the salad, mysterious ""cream sauce"" on the side. It was, of course, soaked in said cream sauce but my hunger overpowered. I mostly gravitated toward the croutons as the iceberg lettuce was a bit...chewy. As an entree I had the pork pelly, rabbit and fig compote. I was mostly attracted to the pork belly but it came out...cold. Blech. Word to the wise, never eat cold pork belly...imagine chewing on layers of cold bacon fat. The rabbit stuff could be best described as tuna salad...it was the best tasting thing on the plate though so I gobbled up the mystery goo. Then there was a fig compote that was just a ridiculous addition as it was so potent that I couldn't figure out how it was supposed to compliment the bland meet piles. Kat insisted we go for the brownie a la mode to save our meal and that truly was a gooey hot ""forgive us"" though my patience was beyond tested at that point. Perhaps it was an off night but I can't imagine how this place survives. The other diners at our long communal table seemed to all be friends with the owner and kept walking in and out of the kitchen and stoking the fireplace etc. It was like being at a dinner party where we didn't know the hosts or the other guests yet tried to be polite about the food even though nobody's really asking you if you like it anyway.",images/stars-1.png

I love the communal cafeteria style table right in the middle of the room. That being said you might have to wait a while on a busy night due to the small amount of seats. On to the food.......I ordered the Vegan Stew. It was hands down one of the tastiest meals I had in my life. I had to refrain myself from licking the bowl. The menu itself will please anyone. My friends ordered the quail, the tempeh club and the pork butt. There was a really good variety of food for everyone. The service was good, they played good punk rock music which prompted a couple of quiet singalongs.

It is a happy median between 4-star quality food, but 2-star everything else. By ""everything else"", I mean service, overheating your customers, and a general snootiness that I guess comes with Castor territory. We called about 5 days in advance to book a table for that Friday evening, and they informed us that had to make up our mind about the precise number of seats (we told them 6 for sure, possible 7), otherwise we were out of luck. Hm, okay... Apparently they were to be so busy that not a single chair could go wasted. Also, we were informed that we could only stay until 9 pm. Um, fine. Upon our arrival we were surprised to see that we were the only ones at the table (there were a couple of people out on the patio), and to our dismay, despite the scorching weather, there was no AC, not even a fan in sight. It was so hot that we all sweated through the entire meal, and one of our party even had to go out and get air to keep from passing out. For the two hours that we were there the entire row of tables remained empty, save for a couple people who sauntered in, only to saunter back out (heat? kicked out because they didn't have reservations?). After all that reservation hubbub, it looked like it was all much ado about nothing. Service - not friendly, but we were serviced well enough. My friend did request salad dressing on the side, which didn't happen. A small slip-up. Food, on the other hand, is excellent (albeit a little pricey for what it is). I enjoyed the tempeh sandwich (huge! enough for two people), which normally comes with a side of fries, but they obliged to my 1/2 fries-1/2 salad request. Yes, I'm one of those people. Delicious, and to my surprise, the salad was perhaps the star of the dish. Dressed with what seemed to be dried blueberries, among other goodies, the salad was outstanding, summery, and unique. I've heard great things about their brunch, perhaps it may be busier which could help with the atmosphere. And if only they could just get over themselves.",images/stars-3.png

I read somewhere it was owned or designed by artists. The ceiling above the bar is cluttered by various sorts of light bulbs in a sculpture. The seating was also strange as it was one long table with chairs on both sides and ends. There was a group of 4 at one end near the window, so we sat at the other end; very reminiscent of high school cafeteria style seating. Water came in a large Grolsch swing top bottle. Espresso came in a clear drinking glass..... This place, I think, is meant to engage your visual senses as much as taste and smell - which scores it a point. One wall opposite the door is made of metal and littered with everything from alphabetic magnets, to a sculpture of a head with red tape over the eyes and mouth. I don't know what is with this place and red tape....., but they seem to think it's a charming decorating motif as you'll see it scattered about the restaurant in various areas. Brunch menu was quite limited with only 5-7 items to choose from including Omelettes, Buck Wheat cakes with fruit [which I had]. For a breakfast I thought it was rather expensive at $12-16 per plate. The menu states that for groups 4 or larger they add 15% gratuity. So don't come here unless you enjoy enforced tipping. However, despite the weirdness, they definitely knew how to cook. My waffles were made from healthy whole grain flower: buckwheat! Combination of blueberries, blackberries, oranges, fried bananas, and whipped cream was lovely. All in all, I don't think I would return for a second visit primarily because of how unnatural the whole place feels. No signs for washroom [one shared by all guests], one long table, weird sculptures all around you.

I've been here several times and always end up talking to new people, a very rare feet in Toronto. I'm sure many unexpected good times are had at this very long marble table and new friends made. The artwork inside is very interesting with foam heads red taped to chains, antler headphones, light fixtures made of various light bulbs, and the giant magnetic board is also a nice touch. The patio is covered by an army camo tarp and is just another quirky addition to the already eclectic decor. The service here is great! The servers are very friendly, knowledgeable, and personable. It feels as if they are old friends. Pairing suggestions are great and they are also pretty good and food suggestions too. Saturday and Friday nights are very busy and the bartender is working away at cocktails and the cook staff are rammed but the servers keep their cool and collected and handle everything with ease. Food here is very good. Although the menu is quite small the quality of food is quite spectacular. They have something covered for herbivores and omnivores alike. If you are a picky eater though, you may want to look elsewhere as the choices are fairly limited. I find it better to have a smaller menu as it helps me choose as the options are already narrowed down. Overall, it's always a fun time out when at Oddfellows as long as your are with the right people. Come with people that are open to meeting new people and don't mind sitting in a table full of strangers, they also can't be too picky an eater.

Step inside though and you're welcomed into a communal dining experience that I initially found off-putting, but warmed to. My friend had been before, and I was taking him for his birthday, so trusting his foodie sense, I was excited. The long communal table made me hungry as our neighbors food arrived while we were waiting, hungry - it did help me decide what I wanted to order though! I had the pork ribs, an unusual choice for me, and I loved every bite. There wasn't a bad thing to say about the food at all. The staff was fast enough, the one guy I remember as vacant stare man from the Victory CafÃ© and he lived up to my memories. At least he was on top of his game here. After dinner when I was more in the mood for dessert, it was a bit weird to smell the stew a few seats away from us. A slight downside to the communal concept, but at the same time it was fun to share the experience with others and watch them dig in. Only one real lame point to me which was the effort that went into small things (not the dÃ©cor though, that was fantastic!). The food is worth every pretty penny it costs, but you'd think they'd have a real soap dispenser, or would serve drinks in a way that would make them also appealing.

It's rare to find a place that puts just as much thought into their vegetarian dishes as their meat dishes. Rare and refreshing. With no sign out front, and just a menu taped to the window, the first time we walked by this place, we thought it was a private party. One big long marble table, with people sitting all the way around it, conversing over imported beers and wine. The communal seating idea is wonderful, and we always meet lovely people and have fantastic conversations over dinner. You get a real feeling of community, in a city that isn't known for it. The interior is filled with recycled-bulb light fixtures, a cozy fireplace suspended off the floor, soft-lighting and flickering candles, and interesting wall installations, all worthy of placement in the MOMA. The ""Herbivore Stew"" and ""Veggie Pasta"" on the menu changes every week from my experience, which means there's always something new and exciting to try. One of the best things I had there was a pasta dish with a tomato and butternut squash sauce, and pumpkin seed pesto with shaved cheese on top. The duck pate, served with honey and nuts, is beyond description. The wild boar or venison burgers are rightfully popular. I've eaten there a few times now, and the staff always remember us, and our favourite dishes. The chefs are always around to give feedback to, and seem to really appreciate it and take it seriously, as they constantly are developing new dishes. It's great to speak to everyone around the table and hear their thoughts on the food they're eating. I've even seen young families walk in with their kids!! You MUST make sure you have room to try the brownie after your meal. Life is not complete without it. After dinner hours, they offer drinks and $3 grilled cheese until close.

The real Chinese dishes are what attracted us after experiencing Chinese from Szchechuan to Beijing to Inner Mongolia and OH made some of my favorites. Today was first time having their food since they reopened. Ordered takeout (we almost always ate in before) and was extremely disappointed. First, the traditional Chinese dishes were gone--was told they threw away too much food--??? Told the Americanized Chinese menu was the same, same cook. Well, something went wrong. Ordered the Chicken corn soup--smaller portion, don't strain your eyes looking for the chicken. Moo shu chicken--everything was so shredded you could hardly tell what was hidden under the overall brown mass of sauce--no discernible pieces of chicken, mushrooms, carrots, etc. although seemed like lots of cabbage and it had a definite and uncharacteristic amount of heat to it. Moo shu isn't supposed to have heat!!!. And looked like flour tortillas instead of thin wrappers and only about a tablespoon of Hoisin sauce. Spring rolls were mostly cabbage, with only flecks of carrot and green onion; could find no protein in them and I think they are smaller. The shredded pork with garlic sauce was a favorite at the old OH but this dish was shredded pork with a pinkish sauce that was as thin as water and tasted only of sugar--no garlic taste at all--and something shredded so finely I couldn't tell if it was green onion or cabbage or what and very little of that. If they have the same cook, they certainly have not kept the same ingredients and cooking style and this food doesn't resemble any of the great food served previously.

I simply have not found any Chinese food worth eating in Madison or Milwaukee, and after a while I gave up looking. A few weeks ago, another friend who also has lived in Beijing, and is lucky enough to live a few blocks from Orient House, sent me a near-frantic e-mail announcing that she had found real Chinese food in Madison. This was monumental. I thought about it every day for the week I had to wait to get to Madison. First of all, order off the Chinese menu. And eat family style. There are plenty of things that even a not-too adventurous eater will like. You may need to like spicy food. For example, try the spicy string beans - I ate these probably four times a week in Beijing - and I think they are just as good here. There are just no green bean like these green beans. Try them. We also got something called fried chicken with dried peppers, which was very tasty small pieces of fried chicken tossed with green onions and hot peppers. Really good. Finally, we ordered yu xiang xie zi, which I unfortunately don't know the exact translation for, although I think it is listed on the Chinese menu as Eggplant in garlic sauce. This is a dish I have thought about for years. It's sticks of eggplant cooked until perfect soft and drenched in a sauce that I don't know how to describe other than to say it's very delicious. My only regret about this meal is that we didn't have about six more people with us so that we could have sat around the lazy susan and tried a lot more dishes. Everything that passed by me reminded me of China. I saw lots of amazing-looking veggies dishes, lots of saucy delicious-I'm-sure pork plates, and generally the menu had me wanting more.

I never thought I'd be saying this, but I found a pretzel that exceeds The Pretzel Shop on the South Side. Ever since my first visit to Philly when I was eight years old, I fell in love with those pretzel street vendors selling those amazing crunchy, chewy, salty treats. Each vender seemed to have a different mustard. Didn't matter, I wanted soft pretzels. I remember my older cousin Frankie taking me to a place near Betsy Ross' house. A portly man, quick witted, W.C. Fields nose, white hair, reminded you of someone's grandfather. Frankie ordered two pretzels and the man squeezed the most amazing mustard on them. We sat on a stoop (Philly speak for steps) and shared a conversation about baseball and we downed those pretzels like they were the last meal we were ever going to eat. Sorry I got off the subject.... After working out at LA Fitness I needed some carbs, I saw the Philly Soft Pretzel Factory and pulled in. My mind was transported back to Philly for just a moment. These looked like the ones W.C. Field's sold out of his cart. I ordered one and went outside on the stoop and took a bite. Cue the harp and fade out like a dream sequence from the 60's TV shows. I was eight years old, Frankie was 17 again, still the same cheesy teen boy mustache, I was wearing P F Flyers, I had on a horrible striped shirt like I was on the TV show Zoom, and a mustard gold Pirates cap on my head. Frankie was showing me on a map where Shibe Park used to be, and how close we were to the Liberty Bell. We'd go there after we finished our pretzels. He wiped the mustard off my face, straightened my hat, told me he'd buy me a Phillie's cap and we walked to the car. Back to the present. It's amazing how a food, or a smell can take you back to simpler times, when all you had to do in life was pass your classes and do homework. The pretzels they sell here remind me of the one they sell on the carts in Philly. They also have Pretzel sandwiches and Pretzel wrapped hot dogs The real hot dogs with the natural casings. If there's no parking on the South Side, head over to Collier and hit this place up. If you've ever had one in Philly, be prepared to take a trip there in your mind.

It came with a good portion of noodles and okay amount of meat but the beef wasn't as flavourful as I would have liked. The spring roll was good! Spring mix was good too. But the nuoc mam/fish sauce to accompany the noodles wassuper diluted and wasn't enough to accommodate the dish. I saw some other reviews saying that the tips were included but I'm unsure if they have continued to do that. Our bill came out correctly with 13% tax.

Love the wraps, the two of us ordered for three and finished everything. Highly recommend if you want an authentic Vietnamese experience. Honestly it was a five star review in the beginning however........the business was being very unethical, for a party of two, they included the tip in the total of the bill without telling us. It was literally a hand written slip that shows you 'total = $XX.XX' no where does it tell you a tip was added. My friend ended up paying two tips. We didn't figure this out until we were en route home. The food was great but this unethical act left a sour taste in our mouth.....",images/stars-2.png

The server was quick and the food came out fast (kind of expected since we ordered pho). I was pleasantly surprised when they brought out spoons and chopsticks being sanitized in hot water. I've never seen this done in a Vietnamese restaurant and really appreciated it. Pho noodle soup (large size with tendon, beef flank, tripe): Overall a solid bowl of pho with flavourful broth and generous amounts of beef and tendon. This was probably the most toppings I've received in a bowl of pho (and I've had my fair share of pho) and it was awesome! Avocado shake: my go-to drink at any Vietnamese restaurant. Love the smooth creaminess when real avocados are used. The flavour of the drink was great, however I believe they made it ahead of time and froze it. The drink was not fully thawed and was too solid to drink. I ended up letting it thaw out for a couple of hours before being able to enjoy it fully.

Drinks: I started off with a cold vietnamese coffee. It tasted great. But I felt like 80% of my cup was ice cubes and there was barely any coffee for $3.50 so I will probably order the hot version next time. Food: My friend got the special beef pho. Nothing spectacular, it is just like any other beef pho. I ordered the grilled pork chop platter with steamed egg and fried egg. The pork chop was tender. The food was decent but I will NOT return based on how unethical this business is. They intentionally increase the price of the grand total when they hand you the total bill thinking that customers do not notice... They add tips to the total of the bill without informing customers. The paper bill just says ""total"" and the total amount. It does not include any calculation. Most customers will assume this total amount is just the subtotal with taxes. But NOPE, it includes tips. This is very unethical of this business. I know they are intentionally doing it because I paid with cash, and they gave me change and it was my natural instinct to leave a tip. Afterwards I thought to myself that the ""total amount"" on the bill didn't seem very right, so I grabbed my phone out to do the calculations and I realized they actually increased the ""total amount"" written on the bill. I was already in my car when I realized I had in fact gave them tips TWICE without realizing and they accepted it. This business is very sneaky and I don't appreciate their way of doing business.

The wrap came with a Greek salad and inside the wrap was turkey tomato, pickles, onions, mixed lettuce, and aoli. All of it was grilled to perfection ans it was absolutely delicious! Especially when I added the siracha sauce!! All of the flavors combined with the sauce made everything just pop and oh so right! My waitress was so nice and continuously checked on me! I felt so relaxed and not rushes at all! All of this delicious food only added up to be $11 with tax and I got to take half home!! Pita Jungle will definitely be my go to spot whenever I visit Phoenix!!!",images/stars-4.png

Maybe we are spoiled by the Chandler location. We also like the Mesa location... Awhatukee not so much. My husband has taken to the small bites happy hour menu. I really like the salmon and the tiki marsala. Oh and the cauliflower side dish is excellent at the Chandler location. I did not enjoy it at the other 2 locations. Each cook makes a difference. I think what makes Chandler location so special is the chef's are in full view of the patrons.,images/stars-4.png

They have an awesome assortment of food for people who like meat and for vegetarians and vegans. What wins me over about Pita Jungle is their consistency with delicious food and the friendly servers. The experience yesterday could have been a bad one, but because they were so attentive and thankful for my patience, my overall experience was pretty good. I called in a to go order around 10:30 am and asked for it to be ready by 11:40. I arrived at 11:45 and the order was not ready. Not only was it not ready, I didn't get my order until after 12:00 pm. Two people were helping me, I hate that I didn't get their names so they can receive kudos, and they kept me posted on the order, they were super apologetic and explained why there was a delay, they walked the food to my car and helped me check the order. I was super impressed with how they handled this situation and even though my order was late, i am more than happy to order from this location again due to the excellent service and quality food!!!",images/stars-5.png

The overall vibe of this place was spectacular. The waitress we had was one of those few that you just feel comfortable with. She also was on top of our requests by brining the check right in time. The food, as usual, was delicious. Now I have the habit of getting the same thing every time, but how can you refuse the Mediterranean Chicken Salad? I did get a taste of on of their cold soups. It was described as almost a salsa flavor, but was so much more than that. The flavors here are always on point. Make sure the try the ice tea here. No sugar needed as it has the right kind of flavor to appeal to the masses sugar free! Not bitter but still tastes like something.

Unfortunately we had a clear view of the kitchen which made it difficult to order food (see photos) I'd like to say the view changed but it only grew worse. At one point the guy preparing the salad mashed down the trash with his food prep gloves on and then continued to make salads : ( We have always loved the other pita jungles we went to and I sincerely hope this was just a rare occurrence. What appeared to us to be the manager (as he mentioned being shorted on the alcohol that he had ordered) walked past this area of the kitchen more than once & didn't seem to give it a second thought. However we did notice (just as we were closing out) that someone did come in and start to sweep the kitchen. So it is quite possible that he said something to them off to the side and they begin to address the issue after we left.,images/stars-1.png

I don't know if she was new or not but the restaurant was like empty. I'm a server and I'm sorry if your service is that slow when the place is practically empty then you shouldnt be a server. Despite the horrible service, the food was good, I had the blackbean burger and it was so good. Everything was good because everyone got something different and they all were satisfied.

Why in the world would Caramelized Cauliflower with Tahini cause such a reaction?! I mean it's Cauliflower. I have a thing for Cauliflower, so we ordered it. This afternoon I decided to try something new and this was just a start. My lunch choice is Beef Kafka. The starter was good. I want the recipe or at least the basic instructions. Nice touch with the Pine Nuts and Onions. The Beef Kafka is what I would call a Mediterranean version of a Tostada, or maybe Nachos. Lavosh topped with cheese, beef, tomatoes, grilled onions, jalapeÃ±os, green onion, Pine nuts, and a creamy sauce lightly across the length. The flavors blended well. If possible the flavors blended TOO well. I enjoy being able to differentiate the flavors of the various items that come together to create a dish, this one wasn't giving me that. May be one of the reasons I like Shawarma? Don't get me wring, the Beef Kafka was good but I couldn't keep my gaze from wandering over to my sons meal. What do you call that? Oh yeah, Pesto Pizza on Lavosh for $1.50 more. Maybe I'll try that next time. Our server was super sweet and darned efficient too. We talked briefly before I ordered cuz my son had stepped away momentarily. So yah, uh huh, she thought it was a date scenario and didn't realize that I was the young mans mother. Oh Jiminy and Jay Jose' Phat ().... Yep, Mom here. So we giggled for a minute and it was back to business. Pita Jungle is one of those places I like to go to occasionally cuz I don't want to get bored with the menu. The relaxed atmosphere appears naturally well lit which makes being able to see the menu a real possibility. Art by local talent is promintly displayed, the nearby water feature provides a peaceful view, and the decor is eclectic (?), Bohemian (?), or simply a crazy mish mash of someone's personal style. I'll be back again soon for the JalapeÃ±o and Cilantro Hummus and Chicken Shawarma. OH yeah, that Cauliflower dish I mentioned, I saw several more orders go out while we were there. Must be a popular item. And I almost forgot to mention something I didn't like. Soda/tea for almost $3.00. -I almost spit up. I guess that might be a way to discourage people from drinking soda, but tea? Or maybe they're trying to encourage customers to order a beer or wine instead? Basically I just really dislike the idea of paying more than a buck fifty for soda. K, 'nuff from me.",images/stars-4.png

My Gambos dish was very sour, it tasted like they forgot the garlic and put a dash too much tomato paste. As a matter of fact that was all that I had tasted. My children's hummus tasted like mashed fava beans with a dash of tahini...no flavor at all. I had asked my waitress if the ingredients has changed and she advised me that they have a new distributor and cut back the oil portion used to mix the hummus.

When in there for lunch today (Sunday) was pretty impressed with the decor and music... They were pretty busy inside (had a huge party of about 20 maybe) so it took awhile for our drink order to be taken (understandable) Drinks came... pretty good stuff My sister and I shared a Caesar Salad and Marg Pizza... Caesar Salad came out we began eating... I find a DEAD BUG in it. It took awhile for the waitress to come over for me to tell her what was in my salad... by that time our pizza had come out... I was TOO GROSSED OUT to even want to eat it. The manager (I am assuming... she never said who she was or gave a name) seemed shocked that we didn't want the pizza and proceeded to ask why we didn't want the pizza. I told her there was a bug in my salad and didn't want to eat anything anymore, and said she could go look at the DEAD BUG on my plate to see why I was grossed out. She left and came back to explain that their were no bugs in their kitchen, but that it was the type of bug that comes in the salad when it's shipped, but that they did wash the lettuce (obviously not well enough, I'm the customer why am I getting a lesson on eating when I've eaten countless salads in my life)... she never asked if there was anything else they could do or offer to buy a round of drinks, or offer for a free pizza on our next visit (nothing to try and help remedy the problem) AND we ordered another round of drinks and still waited more than what I believe should have been appropriate for a table that was unsatisfied with what was going on. We were then not followed up with by her, or even acknowledged again. In the end it's not the servers fault that this had happen, but being in the hospitality industry I understand what GOOD customer service is, and when you apparently don't care about a table... We were charged for everything, the waitress had to take the check back to take off salad and pizza. It is a shame the manager could care less about this event.. I'm normally VERY forgiving when stuff like this happens, but how the situation was handled infuriates me and I am very unhappy with my experience at this establishment.

I love their new philosphy! They are really trying to focus on using organic and healthy ingredients and are implementing more green, sustainable practices - definitely love supporting that! I've had lunch there twice in the past month. We sat out on their nice covered patio (complete with misting fans and sunshades for when it heats up). The first time we each ordered their lunch special (a perfect hearty meal - 1 slice of pizza, a salad, and a drink for only $7.95). My favorite is the puttanesca slice (tomato, artichoke hearts, olives, feta), but make sure to ask what their slice of the day is. My favorite salads are the Chopped Italian, Pear Gorgonzola, or Spinach. Yesterday we ordered a small Diavola pizza (carmelized onions, roasted peppers, pepperoni, and spicy sausage) and the spinach salad. The diavola is one of my favorites - I'm a sucker for carmelized onions and roasted peppers and it has a little spice to it. My boyfriend loves the Organic Santa Cruz sparkling lemonade they offer there, so we usually order that (I also like their regular strawberry lemonade). They offer a great variety of menus items - appetizers, salads, pastas, pizzas, and more. They have a wide variety of crust options (including gluten-free), They also have a ""pizookie"" style pan cookie (a solid dessert, but nothing comes close to Oregano's). They have a good wine selection and bar too. With all of the selection, there is definitely something for everyone. Keep in mind this isn't Domino's or Papa John's.

She got tired of rice. First of all, during the work day, the average person has approximately one hour lunch breaks, not one and a half, not two. One. It was 45 minutes before the waitress even took our order. I told her that i only had an hour lunch. She stated no problem. Ordered for my two children the gluten free pizza. Myself the Thai Chicken, my sister and her husband the Hawaiian pizza. 1/2 an hour later the waitress brings two of the pizzas and says she will be back with the third, the gluten free pizza for the kids (mind you they are 2 and 4). It never comes. So not only is my food getting cold but the kids cannot eat, and even if i could eat, not having the kids food means that no one gets to enjoy theirs. Call over the waitress who hands us our bill, and wants to charge us for the pizza we did not get. UM NO! Says that they cooked the wrong crust, and that she would bring it out for the kids to eat. Responded with ""No she has a gluten allergy"". Says she will have slices of the same out in 2 minutes. 10 minutes later, no slices. Call her over to ask, and ask for manager. Manager does not come over. I go to the front of the restaurant and ask for the manager. He is argumentative and combative about taking the pizza (which i still don't have) off the bill. WTF????? I mean seriously. His reasoning was that he gave us two slices instead (which by the way we did not order) and that we were offered the pizza with the wrong crust that we refused. Mind you FOOD ALLERGY! Is this guy a moron? I told him that under no circumstance was I going to pay for it. And if he had a problem I would be happy to talk to the owner.

I must say that my experience with this restaurant is different then most people's. I have been here 3 times and if I am driving down to the Valley, I make it a point to try to eat here. I have only been here for lunch. On all 3 occasions, our service was excellent and the food was fresh and outstanding! We get the pizza, salad and drink lunch combo. Plenty of food for the price. I am guessing that the average consumer doesn't understand all that goes into the pricing at a restaurant. Not only do you have the cost of your overhead (rent and utlilities), but you have labor costs and food costs. If you are using fresh food (as Picazzo's does) the cost goes up. So if you like fresh food that doesn't come from a jar, box or can, then you have to pay the price. I for one and willing to spend an extra few bucks and know that I am getting fresh food prepared from scratch. I highly recommend Picazzo Pizza. Enjoy!",images/stars-5.png

I went to one in Tempe when it first opened a few years ago. I don't remember much about it but I guess it couldn't have been too bad because I went back. This time, I went on a Thursday night at about 7:30 and the place was mostly dead. We were seated promptly on the patio per our request because the weather is finally tolerable outside. Our party of 3 ordered a cheap bottle of wine, the baked brie to start, a Caesar and a wedge salad, and a large thin crust pizza. Our small salads were HUGE but very very good. The large salads are probably as big as the table and could feed a small army. The baked brie was also very sizable but very good as well. The give you a bunch of flat bread, 2 roasted cloves of garlic and 2 melted chunks of brie. The pizza (1/2 peperoni, sausage and ricotta, and 1/2 pesto & artichoke) was also very tasty. I would definitely get the peperoni, sausage and ricotta pizza again. The next time I visit I would just get a salad and pizza to share. I didn't realize that the portions would be so ginormous. The salads, appetizer and pizza could have seriously fed around 5 people. I guess that is why they can get away with charging so much for their food. I see some issues with the service here on Yelp, but our waiter was very fast and friendly and I couldn't have asked for anyone better. I will definitely be back again. Oh, and this place is on restaurant.com so before you go you can buy a $25 or $50 gift certificate for just a couple bucks. It was well worth it for us and would do it again.",images/stars-4.png

Picture this - in comes two rowdy kids and a couple of overheated parents and everything *could've* gone badly. But they didn't. Our waitress (7 mos. preggers!) could've been surly, but she was very helpful and friendly. The hostess brought out a couple of table toys (Barbie laptop, Etch-A-Sketch) to entertain our kids - it worked. My wife had to order from the gluten free menu, and there was no fuss at all from the waitress. She gave us time to order, they brought us bread at the table when we asked (for the kids) and didn't charge us. My wife order the salad which was huge and we split it deliciously. My ravioli with gorgonzola was excellent, the kids' Margherita pizza was yummy (though they didn't really like the tomatoes on top), and my wife's gluten-free eggplant meal was great. Sure the bill topped $60, and I tipped her nicely, so I wouldn't make this an every weekend place, but it certainly fit the tab on Friday night.",images/stars-4.png

She actually told us to enjoy our meal, unfortunately she was already 10 feet away with her back to us when she said it. Wow...never felt that welcome before! The food (a small thin crust shrimp scampi pizza, a child's cheese pizza and a salad with chicken) took forever. And when it finally arrived, it was a whole lot less than satisfying. The salad was bland, with two pieces of chicken and 12 tons of lettuce. The child's pizza was okay, but how can you screw that one up, right? The scampi pizza was another story entirely. When you order a $15.00 pizza, you expect to maybe have a couple slices left over for tomorrow's lunch, right? Not at ol' Picazzo's! Here's a pic of the pathetic pie. FIFTEEN DOLLARS, ladies and gentlemen. That's $1 per shrimp! What a bargain!! I've had microwave pizzas you cook on that little gray paper box that were tastier and crisper.

I know the signs outside say they have award winning lunch specials and I hoped that extended into dinner, of course. First of all, $18 for a medium pizza (6 slices)!?!?! Damn. I figured it must be fantastic, and I thought ... what the hell. I got the Bourbon Street Pizza. It smelled awful the whole drive back to my hotel. So pungent and fowl, I immediately regretted my decision. Sure enough, 5 minutes later, it was one of the best tasting pizzas I've put in my mouth (deja vu for me). Credit goes out to the hand-tossed dough, and the quality of the ingredients. I liked it so much I went back two days later to get a Pesto Margerita pizza. It was just ok. For a fancy pizza, it was better than a chain pizzaria (sp?) could make it, but not as good as before. They did, however, make an Awshm tortilla enchilada soup, and their bread is great. I give them four stars because I don't live here, and the novelty of eating fancy schmancy pizza that's not called california pizza kitchen (I live in LA) was, well, a bit of a novelty. There were so many items on the menu I wanted to try that I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, even though their pizza is ridiculously expensive and smells awful (both time, what are the odds?).

However, for the most bland, white washed, white bread place on the planet, it is good pizza. Do not order the weird garlic bread crust, just order the original thin crust. As for which pizza to order, there is only one that is truly good. It is the QUATTRO FORMAGGI. Okay, okay, hang on, it is not like any quattro formaggi you would pick up at 1 am in North Caldwell, NJ. But let's be real, we are in Scottsdale, the fact that they put quatto formaggi on the menu without putting in brackets (4 cheese) so the many presbyterian woman would know what it meant is an accomplishment. Moreover, no one in Scottsdale is even out at 1 am. Those presbyterian women have to be in bed by 11, why does anyone need to be up at 1 am? This is a really good pizza. The combination of flavors is fabulous. It is dead on. There is the sweetness of the pears that mixes with the sharpness of the gorgonzola. It is the correct blend of flavors that mix in your mouth, dance on your taste buds and allow you to say that this pizza is alright. This is a good place to grab a pizza.",images/stars-4.png

Also gone were the chips with a spicy cream cheese spread, previously put on your table without charge as a welcome while you were seated. Now the menu is mostly Asian and a bit ""weird"". My friend ordered ""Sweet/Sour Chicken"" which looked like a McDonald's order of chicken nuggets with a gelatinous sauce on top. No rice - that was $4 X-tra! Even the fries for the expensive burger were X-tra as well. Our waiter, Jesus, was very attentive and efficient, but was upset at hearing all our negative comments about the new menu, especially when I said ""We were NEVER coming back again"".

They were overcooked and the seared spices were a soggy mess. The potatoes and Dijon dressing were great though. -Eggs Benedict: Very good, cooked perfectly. They do it a little different and give you smoked salmon instead of canadian bacon. Not a bad change but they were a little cheap on the quantity of salmon. -Matador Hamburger: Fantastic burger and they will cook it rare. If you order one well done, you shouldn't be allowed to review any red meat. -Center Cut Filet: Obviously not a prime cut. Perfectly cooked and seared. Veggies were also well seasoned and not overcooked. Good choice. -Salmon: Great seasoning, slightly overcooked and bizarre sauce with the consistency of pudding under the garnish. The sauce added nothing to the fish. -Creme Brulee: Very nicely done, maybe a little too much heat on the sugar, but still delish! -Caprese Salad: Tomatoes were flavorless and old (dried out appearance). Mozzarella was obviously a Costco purchase (not bad though). If I wasn't eating here for free, I would balk at it just for the prices let alone the mixed quality of the food. No hot waitresses here, but the server staff was great.",images/stars-2.png

It tries to be high-end but has nothing going for it -- not even that view of the ugly fake lake. Definitely not worth the hefty price tag! We had a 6:30 reservation that night and they had already run out of the rib appetizer by the time we got there. When I ordered a salad and soup as an entree, they told me I shouldn't do it because the two plates ""wouldn't fit next to each other."" I persisted, and they made it seem like a huge inconvenience -- but when the plates came out, everything fit just fine. My mom's salad was wilted and my lobster chowder was bland with absolutely no taste. The salmon entree was dry and the carne ranchero annoyingly chewy. We really couldn't get out of here quickly enough, and ended up snacking in our hotel room afterwards!",images/stars-1.png

It's still a fast-food restaurant, but definitely a step up from the chain. The burgers are tasty, and the poutine is really good - the gravy is not too runny, it's got lots of flavour, and the cheese curds are fresh. I haven't tried the chicken burger, but girlfriend wasn't a huge fan of it - so I'm sticking to the beef burgers. I've also been for breakfast too (on the weekends), and it's a solid. Typical Quebec breakfast of eggs, fruit, (really good) home fries, beans, and toast (and cheap for the portions you get). This is place is my go-to for hangover days, 'cause it's cheap and good.

restaurants_list.html,Resto-Bar La Belle Province,http://mlg.ucd.ie/modules/yalp/reviews_rqtruxU_kvgCYNT5rgoB7Q.html,negative,0,"This is one odd little neighborhood diner. I'm not generally a fan of la belle province. I find their food to be slightly below average your typical diner food, and their prices tend to be relatively expensive. Fortunately, it doesn't seem to be very standardized between La Belle Province restaurants. I lived next to this little resto-bar for close to a year, and only recently (4 years later) came back for another meal and wrote this review. The restaurant has a small diner area up front, with 3 ""banquettes"" and a counter area with several bar stools. As you enter, you're faced with a large beer fridge and a wall covered with sheets of paper describing the various combo meals available. You order at the counter, pay, sit down and a waitress brings your food to you. Late on a random Sunday evening, we ordered the 2 hot-dog + Poutine meal, which after taxes and tip ended up being close to $10. Not too bad. The hotdogs were streams and had mustard, relish and sauerkraut. Perfect. The poutine was decent. Some of the fries weren't fully cooked, and the cheese weren't super fresh. You could tell it had been put in the fridge, which takes the squeakiness and the oiliness away. The sauce was your typical poutine-mix gravy. Nothing special. There might have been even a little too much of it, and it ended up being quite the mess at the bottom of it. The restaurant also doubles as a bar. You can have a beer for $3.25 (Dec 2009 visit) as you eat, or you can go in the tiny bar area at the bank and mingle with the bilingual crowd who watches football on a couple small TVs. Not a bad place, not stellar either. If you're in the area and are looking for a quick bite/drink on a late Sunday night (when most is closed in Verdun), Resto-Bar La Belle Province in Verdun should do the trick.",images/stars-3.png

They even have Slush Puppies!!! What???? Yeppers, they sure do! We both decided on the birch beer. Sooooo good! I went simple and got a cheeseburger and fries. BF got a pastrami with cole slaw sandwich and fries. I have to agree with most on here and say the food here is outstanding! Very fresh and full of flavor. The fries were not greasy nor the burgers salty. And I for one do not use or like salt very much. I love how the skin was left on the fries! Very yummy!

We got there, and I'll admit, from the outside looking in, and even once inside the door, I was a little put off. I wasn't sure I wanted to stay there and eat. All that changed once we got a good dose of the service (and food)! She ordered some pizza bread, with pretty much every non-meat topping available, and some cheese fries with no chili. I ordered a Chicago dog with chili fries (no cheese). We got a few drinks from their AMAZING soda selection. She got two of the original Dr. Peppers, and I got a Leninade. She ended up hating the Dr. Pepper because it used real sugar, and drank my Leninade...a taste of things to come once married I suspect. The pizza bread, according to her, was delicious. The fries, superb. My dog was amazing. I expected the actual hot dog to be a little bigger, but with all the things you get on the dog, it's a real meal. I ate that, and some of the fries (which were really really good...though I should have gotten the chili cheese fries instead of just chili) and was stuffed. The people that work there are very friendly. They brought the food to us rather than just calling out our names, offered to exchange the unopened Dr. Pepper for something different since she didn't care for it, and had good humor when my fiance made a joke about them not having veggieburgers. The only thing holding it back from being 5 stars is that the tables needed wiped off.",images/stars-4.png

The food is fresh, fast, and inexpensive. If you want burgers, subs, dogs, pizza-bread, gyro, salad, handmade fries & onion rings, PBJ with homemade jam -- they've got it. The chicken sandwich had a light crispy breading and a solid chunk of breast meat. The burger was a smaller patty (available as a double) but not dry, and the condiments were fresh and generous. For both sandwiches, the standout part was the fresh bun from Simply Bread (local). It was soft/firm enough to be just right, and had great flavor. They have a cooler chock full of interesting and bizarre selections from Pop The Soda Shop (Jones Soda, imported ginger ales and root beers, glass bottle real sugar sodas from mexico, dublin dr pepper, etc). My spicy Bleinheim Ginger Ale did not skimp on the ginger flavor! A couple of real ex hippies would do it like this -- no flashy superficial emphasis on outward appearances and gimmicks, just quality, freshness, and friendliness that is truly genuine and sincere.

The 'cajun' beer battered fries were atrocious. No seasoning or flavor and tasted like soap and old oil. The regular fries were fine and the burger was ok but a little well done for my taste--they didn't ask us how we'd like them cooked. I definitely won't be back and you should go elsewhere if you want a restaurant experience. The place also seemed kind of dirty--the tables were sticky and the floor was slippery.

BUT both times... the order has been messed up (even when it was written down on paper and given to them.) I can forgive that, but I can't believe the hush puppies and fries that we just got. The oil has to be beyond bad. The hush puppies were completely charred and black, and left an awful after taste. The fries had the same disgusting odor, and old burnt oil flavor. I've heard about old oil here before, from reviews and an article. I figured that after that, it would be something that they were very wary of and keeping an eye on.

The owner, his wife, and staff are super-friendly, and they deliver delicious food. We have had the brisket sandwich, the pulled turkey sandwich (three times), the burger (two times), the beignets, the Cajun fries, and their Nicaraguan coleslaw (two times). All of the items are outstanding, but our favorites are the burger, the pulled turkey sandwich, and the coleslaw. The burger comes with free bacon, lettuce, tomato, jalapenos, and some other toppings for one flat rate of only $3.50. The toppings are large and very fresh. The pulled turkey sandwich really melts in your mouth. I would recommend adding the Carolina sauce to this sandwich for extra flavor, but you can still eat it without the sauce and still love it. Lastly, we really enjoy the Nicaraguan coleslaw because it is so unique. For example, it does not have a mayo base to it. Also, it just has a very good homemade taste.

We ordered a Bacon mushroom jalapeÃ±o cheeseburger, a Mayo mushroom cheeseburger, a smoked turkey sandwich, beer battered Cajun fries, and mac and cheese balls. First thing I can say is the cheeseburgers are $3.50 flat with any toppings you want and whichever sauces you want. The cheeseburgers are descent. If I was in the area I would stop and get one, but I wouldn't drive very far to go there specifically for something to eat. The smoked turkey sandwich was very tender and moist, but had way too much seasoning ( salt and pepper, especially the pepper) and no real smoke flavor at all. The beer battered Cajun fries are really wedges with way too much batter that tasted like old fryer oil and the potato portion was gummy not flaky. The mac and cheese balls really tasted bad as still the old fryer oil flavor along with some processed flavor. The coating on these is similar to a hush puppy consistency not a normal batter or breadcrumb type, kind of weird. The place is simple asthetically, but it works for what it is, and the people behind the counter seemed very nice. If you live in the area, it is fine for a descent cheap cheeseburger, but I wouldn't recommend the sides other than maybe french fries and hope the oil in the deep fryer is fresh.",images/stars-3.png

When it comes to food quality and taste, this restaurant competes with the very best vegan spots in Toronto. Some highlights: 1. black bean burger with the Gouda cheese. Please do yourself a favour and add the (coconut based) Gouda cheese. The taste is EXPLOSIVE! It's the perfect compliment to the bean burger. 2. The tacos. The tacos were presented beautifully! Very much of finesse. The cucumber relish gives it a nice sweet taste, but you get that kick from a couple slivers of hot pepper. Very well balanced dish! 3. The smoked tomato soup is a MUST have. 4. The brownie is a loaf style brownie, but is wonderfully crafted; even has flax in it! Topped with a coconut cream chia pudding and chocolate pudding gnash, and gooseberries on top.

We all started with the special potato soup with corn bread that had kale and fennel. Both were delicious! The soup was thick and creamy and the corn bread was a dry, crumbly texture and it was a great start to the meal. Friend 1 ordered the tacos filled with purple yams on a soft corn tortilla.....very nice flavour. Friend 2 ordered the cauliflower and spinach dish which had a nice lemony flavour. I ordered the chickpea crepe which was filled with broccoli and cabbage I believe. It was cooked just right and tasted wonderful. The cauliflower dish and chickpea crepe came with a side salad which had a nice light vinaigrette, but part way through I noticed a hair in the salad. I would have assumed it was my hair but it was in the salad, not on it, so I couldn't be sure. My friend had the special pumpkin cheesecake for dessert which she enjoyed. It had a light, somewhat granular texture....not smooth or creamy, but very tasty. Unfortunately, we found a 2""piece of fuzz in it. I ordered the oat and maple butter tart which tasted horrible.....I had my friends taste it to make sure it wasn't just my taste buds and they agreed. I told the chef/owner and he took it back, tasted it and agreed. He said he tried a new vegan margarine and that resulted in the poor taste. He threw them all out. We ordered 2gf choc chip cookies instead and I enjoyed it. It def tasted gf so my son would not like it but I really enjoyed it. When the bill arrived, we were not charged for any of the dessert items and we were all given cards to return for a discounted meal.

I requested Teriyaki chicken since it was the only edible looking dish they had to offer (I was wrong about that), with a side of white rice. The teriyaki chicken had a bad flavor and bad texture that I didn't know if it went bad or it is how they prepared it. I took several bites but was afraid to continue any further because I was afraid how I would feel afterwards. Overall, I will never return to this place nor I would recommend it to anyone else.

As it turns out, Star Ginger serves up a decent bowl of pho, for $7. You have your choice of beef or chicken, and it is made to order as soon as you pay for your meal at the cashier. The pho was a sizable portion in a large bowl. I chose chicken, and there were a lot of white meat chicken chunks in the bowl, as well as freshly shredded onion, pho noodles, and cilantro. The broth was rich and a little unctuous, and there was a plate of fresh basil, bean sprouts, and lime wedge on the side. They also included a disposable soup spoon and a small container of sriracha and hoisin sauce. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and quantity of this meal. They did a decent job with the pho dish, and if I were at this food court again, I definitely wouldn't mind trying another bowl of pho!",images/stars-4.png

Well, I was definitely able to find plenty of delicious food and drink, and overall I was very satisfied with this place! We ordered the Brussels spouts to start. They were SO GOOD! I ordered the Miso Ramen. I was very pleased with the flavor fullness of this dish. I don't do mushrooms so I asked for it without and that was no problem. I would order this again for sure, it was delicious! My friends ordered the Dan Dan and Khai Soi. The Dan Dan was very good! Nice rich flavor. I love a good peanut sauce. I didn't try the Khao Soi as I am not keen on super spicy things, but my friend who ordered it said it was great. We also ordered some specialty cocktails that were all delicious and very pretty!

Our waitress finally came after we asked another server to go get her and then she said the order never went in and retook our order. We then waited another 20 minutes before it came out. Meanwhile, we had to flag down people to ask for water refills. I'm not one to ever complain (it makes me super uncomfortable), but this service was beyond unacceptable.

Loved the fried calamari and pork ribs very well made and appropriate spice/hotness level. I would suggest for people who cannot handle spicy food to not order this dish as the heat might be a little over powering for the palette. The dumplings were no big deal, the outer dough of the dumpling was very thick and the pork fell right out of the dumpling when I tried to eat it. Those dumplings stickers could be make a thinner. The pork ribs were my favorite, i recently checked the menu again and found out that they don't have those ribs on their menu anymore, I hope they get it back soon!

I was excited! I thought my noodle dishes were going to be amazing. Omg... the broth was so bland. I had to ask for soy sauce just so I could at least have some flavour besides water and spice. I ordered the Veggie Ramen and my date ordered the Spring Ramen... I guess his was extremely fishy and bland as well. If any of you have been to Ha Long Bay for their Pho, that my friends, is flavour or if you'd made some of your own Top Ramen, that my friends... is flavour.

We ordered the following dishes: Farmer John's Cheese Curds, Cheesy Ddeokbooki, and Shio Raman. Below is our opinion of the dishes that we've tried: Farmer John's Cheese Curds: The waitress told us to put the kimchi on the cheese curd and dip it in the sauce to enjoy the play of flavors. We thought the mesh of flavors were overwhelming and did not work together. The flavors were overly sharp and bitter. The cheese curds, however, were of good quality and tasted best by itself, even though it had a bitter aftertaste (kind of odd). Cheesy Ddeokbooki: We weren't sure what this dish was supposed to be. To be fair, we've never had traditonal Ddeokbooki, but the cheese didn't work with the dish. The wife thought that there was also not enough cheese to be called cheesy. We both agree that the dish was a little messy and lacked substance. Shio Raman: The best part of the raman was the pork belly (yum). Other than that, the broth was too fishy and I didn't care for the semi-wavy noodles. This is definitely not your usual shio raman. I also prefer Graze's raman (same owner). The broth is not fishy and felt more fulfilling. Overall, we didn't enjoy our dishes because the flavors didn't work. The menu also appeared to be overpriced. $18 for bibimbop? $15 for Japchae? We may come back to try other dishes, but don't recommend the dishes we've tried.",images/stars-2.png

It literally taste like water with fat in it. Not creamy or flavorful like it should be. Took away another star because the atmosphere was just strange. Not a cool hip-vibe like we were expecting. Also, They charge 18 bucks for Bibimbap which is crazy. I got it with steak and I had to search for the steak in the bowl, only a few tiny pieces of steak.

We didn't have to wait long and the wait allowed us to look over the cocktail menu. Usually Korean restaurants don't serve craft cocktails so offering them is a plus! There was only one bartender who was busy helping the party of 4 while we were mostly ignored. But we quickly got called to our table and ordered drinks that way. I had the mango tequila cocktail and the chai one. The mango one was good but could have been spicier. So, order it. Extra spicy! The chai one tasted like someone spiked my chai tea in a ""that's really different"" tasting kind of way. I probably wouldn't order that again. For eating, we shared the chili eggplant appetizer and squid. The squid was just normal deep fried calamari. It was just fine. The eggplant was pretty good and came sprinkled with Thai Basi and tofu. I really enjoyed it. For dinner, I shared a bibimbap with the spicy sauce on the side (a recommendation from our server, which ended up being a great recommendation because then we could also use the sauce on the table n addition to what it came with). This was pretty good but when you live in a large metro area with tons of amazing Korean food, this Madison bibimbap was just a but sub par to what I've had before. So based on the other reviews of this place, the food was decent, drinks made this experience better and the service was attentive. Im not sure if it's worth an hour wait but if you haven't ever tried Korean, it's probably the place to go. I would also recommend this as a good first date place. It's not loud and you get to be adventurous with your food order and again, the cocktails. The only other thing I'll mention is they have ""fancy"" silver-looking chopsticks. Whatever they are made out of makes using chopsticks even more difficult, so I asked for their regular takeout chopsticks that made me feel less clumsy.",images/stars-3.png

I have honestly been going in and out of the apartment complex that this restaurant is attached to for months now and every time I gawk over how amazing it smells going past this restaurant. So finally a groups of friends and I decided it was time to try it. We went around 7pm on a week night so we had no issues getting a table and I assume it is like that most nights of the week, but as it goes in Madison, the weekends inevitably bring on long waits. When we arrived we were greeted by a perfectly sweet hostess and server that continued to give us fabulous service throughout the meal, checking up on us frequently and giving us more than enough suggestions on what to enjoy on the menu. Each meal was presented with a little guideline about how best to eat it from the cooking staff such as stirring up the bipmbap and noddle dishes because they are layered at first. But I thought this was a lovely touch to their service that clearly showed they wanted you to enjoy your dish as much as possible. I wish I could've tried some of the appetizers like the pork buns or the potstickers because I watched them come out of the kitchen throughout the meal and they smelled/looked fantastic. So if you get the chance to go there I certainly recommend coming with a big appetite so that you can try as much as possible. My friends and I all got separate dishes that looked absolutely fantastic. I went with the bipmbap with spicy tofu, although you get choices of meat to go in if you would rather have those, my choices were beef and pork, but I was feeling the tofu so it wouldn't be too heavy of a dish. When you're given the bipmbap you're warned that the dish it is served in is piping hot and not to touch it (you should definitely listen to that). One thing I love about the bipmbap dish is the crispy rice that comes at the bottom, and when you're given your food here the rice isn't actually crispy yet, you're supposed to let the rice sit on the sides of the bowl to crisp. So even though they tell you to mix up your dish throughout the meal in order to keep the food hot, you actually aren't going to get any of the crispness if you push around the rice off the sides of the bowl. Additionally, bipbmap always comes with an egg on top (another reason why I am obsessed with this meal), but when they serve it to you the egg isn't fully cooked, but is placed on the side of the bowl so that it continues to cook and supposedly as you stir your food around the egg will cook more. I am going to be honest and say I am not sure my egg cooked all the way through, which is slightly concerning, and I feel like it would be better if they cooked the egg a little more so you wouldn't have to worry about eating a raw egg. So although there are a few iffy portions of this dish I ate almost all of it because it was so delicious. The spicy sauce that the meat is covered in is very spicy, but also the perfect blend of spices that you honestly can't stop eating. I highly recommend this dish, but just beware of the crispy rice/egg concerns. All in all, this place had wonderful service and fabulous food. I know some reviews haven't been all that great, but if you're looking for Asian fusion in Madison I think this is most definitely your best bet.",images/stars-4.png

The KBC might as well be called KFC with rice and ketchup. Oh and bland kimchi too. The Dan Dan is basically spaghetti with generic ""Asian"" spices. Ragu with chili and sesame oil anyone? The BBQ Pan Fry Noodle might have been worth it if half the meat hadn't been grisly and inedible. Sujeo is a step up if your baseline is Americanized stripmall Chinese.

My first time here was a week or two after it had opened. I ordered the japchae. It was okay, but not great.

I fully support the idea of using local ingredients! My first experience was a three star, but not bad enough to keep me from coming back. My SECOND time was a COMPLETE NIGHTMARE! (I'm sorry to say this, because I really did hope this place had such potential) i got FOOD POISONING!!! I ordered the Bun Cha noodle dish from the noodle bar last week with the Thai sausage. The noodle dish was extremely salty and I should have been more reserved with the dressing I guess. However, I was so hungry I ate it all-including all of the sausage. After the meal, I had a pretty bad stomach ache, but thought it was because I ate so much. The next morning was like pure hell. I woke up super early and felt like I was going to die. It took me five days to recover fully-I was finally able to eat food on the third day. I will not be heading back there. Tory Miller, you're other places are great, but this one is definitely not of the same caliber. I also heard from a friend that her coworker also got really sick after eating here.

We had to wait one hour for our table. Typically, this is good for a business since it means they are busy/making money. They have a good system of texting you when your table is ready so we were able to go elsewhere during our wait. Upon getting seated, we were presented with a dim sum cart and then we got 2 cups of water for our group of 5. Normally, each person gets their own cup of water. The server informed us that each bamboo container of food costs $5. After we chose a few dishes, we finished each dish and proceeded to wait until the next cart came around. This took half an hour, only now when they came, we were then informed that dim sum cart service has stopped and it was provided on an order basis. We were allowed time to see what we wanted to order...and when we ordered, we waited another hour for the food. When I went to the restroom during this time, I heard one of the waiters inform the woman who seemed to be running the floor that dim sum cart service was back on per the chefs request. At the end of our hour-long wait, the food still did not arrive and we decided to leave and just pay for what we already ate. In addition to this, the wait staff/hostess seemed disinterested and unprepared. Waters were not refilled the entire time we were there and staff members seemed to be getting a lot of questions about the lack of cart service from other patrons. Even the woman who appeared to run the floor was speaking to the wait staff with increased volume. Positive things: we were not charged anything for our dissatisfaction. The interior is very nice and has a nice upscale feeling to it. The realization that they do not specialize in ONLY Dim Sum service; we will have to try their non-Dim Sum dining service to get the full picture. To be honest, this restaurant caters to Caucasian Americans who enjoy hyping up Asian-style food service and cuisine with disposable income.

Semantics aside, the above sentiment doesn't quite change the fact that Sujeo offers a new dimension to Madison's already growing and diverse restaurant game; a friend of mine who works at Epic and I decided to come here after having breakfast at Graze (whose owner, Tory Miller, also happens to be the brain child of Sujeo) and being so impressed by the food that we decided we need more. Besides the fact that everything we ordered that evening did not requite the restaurant's namesake utensil (sujeo == spoon in Korean), the meal was pretty excellent: Appetizer Salad (now replaced by Kohlrabi Salad) Very nice mix of heirloom tomatoes with other organic greens, with chicken innards mixed in, topped with a sprinkle of sesame seeds and other spices. I'm shocked that this is no longer on the menu. Whole Fried Fish I forget what the fish was that evening, but it was crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, garnished with tangy and somewhat spicy sauce all around the fish. Khao Soi The first Khao Soi I've tried that come with an entire chicken drumstick, not removed from bone! The curry-broth was point on, the crispy noodles were brilliant. The restaurant wasn't as mind-blowing as we hoped it to be, but it was still a solid choice -- oh, and the next person that keeps professing the hypothetical existence of ""Tonkatsu ramen"" (Tonkatsu == amalgamation of Japanese ""ton"" which means pig/pork and english ""cutlet""; Tonkotsu == Ton [pig/pork] + Kotsu [bone]) needs to be hunted down by a lynch mob.",images/stars-4.png

He is letting his Asian pride fly in his newest venture. Graze has long had some Korean flavor throughout the locally sourced menu: Bibimbap, a Korean stone bowl cooked rice dish, and Kimchi gracing it's Ruben for a garlic-y spice kick. Sujeo is a complete departure into Pan-Asian flavors. All created with local fresh and extremely high quality ingredients. Chef Miller is straying into some seriously deep Asian waters for the Cuisine at Sujeo. With a single visit to Sujeo with a few dining companions we visited China, Vietnam, Korea, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore and Sri Lanka. Chef Miller has cherry picked some of the best dishes from the wide Asian World and made them his own. Each dish is well prepared, using the highest quality ingredients from around Wisconsin and the US. Each dish has been refined to the point of culinary masturbation. Can great food be so rich and flavorful that it makes you feel dirty? Imperial roll The imperial rolls were a ground pork and shrimp roll. Shrimp and pork are commonly mixed together in Vietnamese and Cantonese cooking to make the most flavorful and interesting fillings for dumplings. This is a rice paper wrapped spring roll which has been deep fried. Salt and Pepper Squid This is an interesting take on Salt and pepper seafood Chinese dishes. Generally a whole shell on shrimp or crab is lightly breaded with five spice and black pepper. The R&G lounge in San Francisco is famous for their Salt and pepper Crab. It's a strange dish in that the breading is stuck to inedible shells, but in the process of cracking and extracting the meat you get bits of crunchy peppery goodness in every bite. Madison's new Asian Sweet Bakery on Park street makes a Salt and Pepper Shrimp tasty enough to eat shell and all. Obviously Squid does not have a shell but the light and peppery breading is similar to other salt and pepper Chinese dishes. Chili Crab is a dish I've only seen in Singapore. It's one of the specialties of that region. In Singapore and Malaysia a chili sauce thickened with eggs is liberally doused over a screamingly fresh crab from Sri Lanka. The mythology surrounding these Sri Lanka crabs is that they grow big and fat in the Bay of Bengal feasting on the outpouring from the Ganges river, a holy river in India which is used as a cremation and burial ground. They say it is this which makes Sri Lanka crabs the best in the world. Nom Nom Nom Chef Tori has decided instead of using the ""one-step from cannibalism"" (delicious BTW) crab to using West Coast Dungeness crab. A very tasty and more local substitute. The Chili sauce it came with was honestly better then some of the best places in Singapore. Sweet, salty, spicy, this dish really hits on all cylinders. Spicy Red Curry with long beans, pickled ginger and crispy shallots. I was expecting a Thai style curry. But boy was I wrong. This was much less balanced then a thai Curry light on spiciness and heavy on sweetness. The closest thing I have had to a curry like this is an Indonesian pork curry often served in a rijstaffel meal. Pork Rendang is one of my favorite dishes around the world and one which is nearly impossible to find outside of either Southeast Asia or The Netherlands. The only thing lacking in this dish was the spicy :( Their Ramen was absolutely killer. The first few bites were overwhelmingly ginger flavored but that quickly mellowed out with the strong deep flavor of the sea. To me it tasted very strongly of crab roe, ginger, and pork fat. It was absolutely a unique (in my experience) and amazing bowl of Ramen. It was so complex it was almost confusing, but in the end was addictively good. The KBC chicken served with a bevy of Banchan (little picked sides in Korean cuisine) is at once a very American dish and a very Asian one. Steaks, hamburgers, apple pie, Asian people know what these dishes are and might have had them before, but the ubiquity of KFC in Asia is of epic proportions. Fried chicken has become an Asian staple. They even have knock-off KFC's in a lot of the Asian world! One of my dining companions called the curry ""Dusky"", and it's a perfect description for that dish. The flavors are deep, sweet, salty, and they taste of the depths of dark Soy Umami. The perfect blend of sweet soy and caramelized protein. That characterizes all of the food at Sujeo. Deeply flavorful, joyously seasoned and only perfectly describable in terms that have nothing to do with food. Check out all my reviews at theglobeonmyplate.blogspot.com",images/stars-5.png

Both the pickles and the soup were top notch. I'm a pickle fanatic and have had a hard time finding quality asian pickles in Madison. These were A++ pickles! Only odd thing was the inclusion of the macaroni salad. Ddeokbokki was super fresh tasting, rice cake was chewy/delicious (it is harder than you would think to find a good rice noodle) and the fish cake was slightly sweet in a well spiced sauce. Chili-braised eggplant was interesting, in a light chili sauce with basil, very innovative. Mango curry was thick, not traditional Thai-tasting, did not appear to have a large amount of coconut milk. The highlight of the curry was the mango, which cut through the other spices in a bright, pleasant way. There were also these curious, thin, crunchy unknown vegetables, and squash. I had hedged on ordering it because Madison does not lack for good Thai restaurants, but I am pleased, because it was great and set itself apart from its contemporaries. We ended the meal with chocolate and strawberry custard, the milk is from Sassy Cow. The custard had nice flavor (as in, it tasted like strawberries and not artificial) and had a slightly grainy texture. I am already planning out my meal for next visit, which might be this week. I have found my favorite restaurant in Madison.",images/stars-5.png

For delivery, we ordered crispy tofu with peanut sauce, chicken satay (peanut sauce), avocado chicken, a beef and chili salad, sticky rice, and a spicy chicken dish I forget the name of. The peanut sauce was water and sugar, with a tiny amount of peanut butter in it. Sure, water and sugar are cheaper than peanut butter -- but really? It was horrible. The fried tofu was not the beautiful puffy crispy tofu you get from other places, but skinny triangles coated with bread crumbs and burned in oil. It went in the garbage, along with the peanut sauce. Next, the description of the beef and chili salad said it was thin slices of beef with mint, cilantro, and chili. Nope. It was nearly raw, inedible beef, in a soupy cabbage, red pepper, scallion, cucumber, and tomato base. I am allergic to tomatoes. I hadn't said that, which is my fault - but tomatoes were not listed in the ingredients, and hardly any of the things that were listed were actually IN the ""salad."" To the garbage bin with that, too. I was left with only chicken satay. It was okay -- until I bit into a piece of chicken still raw in the center. This place is not only awful - it's a health hazard.

Delicious thinly sliced well marinated beef, eggplant, potato and that curry sauce, sooooo goood!

It is definitely a packed place but I think they dont like coloured folks going over there. In this day and age that is so sad especially in a city as diverse as Toronto with all its diversity. The waitress was awesome but the patrons are just crazy. There is this small dance floor. I was dancing on the dance floor and for no apparent reason, this guy just kicked me on my chest. Usually when I go out for the weekend, I spend about a 100 bucks. I guess I will be taking my business else where.

It was around 3 pm and the place wasn't busy; our server came over promptly and took our drink order. Looking good. But not so, for they arrived an eternity later. We ordered the mini burgers and the wings to share. The food also took a decade to show. The burgers were okay I guess, but the wings were a big disappointment. Eight measly wings for $15. The homemade sauce just tasted like Franks Red Hot which I like but it's mighty unhomemade. And the wings had a sprinkling of black sesame seeds on them which had a bitter flavour. And getting the bill, let's just say it was a Christmas miracle. Our server was in absentia so long I thought we'd have to wait until 2014.

restaurants_list.html,The Bier Markt,http://mlg.ucd.ie/modules/yalp/reviews_QrTvQw_aZOLk_8FZ8tQ_-w.html,negative,0,"Some context for my harsh feelings towards 'Bier Markt': Okay - I am really into beer and being new to the city, I prodded around for bars in Toronto that would be to my liking. Bier Markt came up often. Hell - it came pretty highly recommended on BeerAdvocate and RateBeer. So expectation were high... ... but it's just a yuppie beer (yes - ""BEER"" not 'bier') bar. With that said, the patio is sufficiently nice and the service was quite courteous. If you like drinking overpriced bottled Belgian beer, this place is alright. But is not a craft beer joint for the following reasons: TAP SELECTION: Maybe I came at the wrong time the draught selection was sorely lacking. The taps selection was comparable to any run-of-the-mill dive bar. Maybe it's just me - but I am only interested in draught selection. I can easily source and buy rare bottles and enjoy it at home. If you're used to joints with a 25+ craft brew rotation, Bier Markt is not for you. Let me put it this way - I had two pints and asked for the bill. I had already had everything else they had on tap -- and I didn't like any of it. We walked down the street to Bar Hop for our beer fix. IMPORT-MANIA: As soon as I saw that they listed the beer by country (they also boast about having beer from 24 countries), I should have just left. I hate any place that does this. When I lived in Japan, I routinely saw nice bars that featured bottles of Budweiser and Coors on display. Yup - Bud and Coors. Why? Because morons think ""beer from further away"" = ""better beer"". Now apply this reasoning to Stella Artois, Czechvar, Heineken, Beck's, etc... do people honestly not realize they are drinking swill just because it's imported? There are some fine Belgian brews available - but lot of European trash beers too. I know they don't have these in the GTA, but if you've been to a Fogg N' Suds (they are all over the place in Vancouver) -- Bier Markt is basically a Fogg N' Suds with 'yuppie guido' set to maximum... actually, the Fogg N' Suds chain has a better brew selection. That's pretty sad.",images/stars-1.png

I can't recall exactly how many pages the beer menu was, but I do remember almost panicking since I won't be able to try them all. Beer Markt had quite an impressive list and although they did not have my favorite Belgium beer Satan Red, I did get a chance to try many others that I've never heard of. My new favorite type of light fruity beer is Fruli. It's a strawberry beer with only 4.5% alcohol and tasted like juice.

I had to open up the flame to heat it up, but it didn't really help, especially because the potatoes were cold and I mean ice cold. I don't really care for potatoes in the fondue but since they were there we ate them. Oh and the bread was OK but not superb. We ended up dunking the potatoes in the fondue pot and leaving them there for a while, sorry for the bad manners, so that they warm up and become edible. That was a few weeks ago and just recently I was there again with friends, this time at the Don Mills location and one of them ordered the fondue. Okay, I will give them the benefit of the doubt, let's see this time... and yes, it was lukewarm again, tasted bland, and the potatoes were cold again, and another friend said that her fries on the side were also cold, so I suppose that's written in their manual to serve the potatoes cold.

I've never been to Bier Markt before, even though I've walked passed it many times, so I was keen on checking it out. (Actually, to be honest, I didn't remember that I'd seen it before and thus I didn't know it was a bar, I thought it was a night beer market festival at the Distillery District, like those Asian night markets that happen once a year. And since I'm not a beer drinker, no one can blame me for not knowing that it's a bar!) When we finally arrived at the Bier Markt at around 1AM, I shocked to see a bar SO packed. (The bar was probably close to reaching its capacity limit.) Although it was very dark and loud on the inside, there was still an upscale European feel to it, meaning it wasn't ghetto at all. (Which is perfect for me!) The bar serves a trendy older crowd, -most people were just a tad older than me and came off as young professionals. (Very much like the crowd at Mill Street Brewery in the Distillery District.) As the name may hint, the bar has a wide selection of beers from all around the world. Although it carries your typical domestic beer, like Molson Canadian, it didn't carry the only beer that I'd ever finished a pint of: the Mill Street Organic, which was very disappointing to me. So I spent the night sipping my friend's Stella. Since the bar was so crowded on the inside, my party and I took it to the patio where we enjoyed each other's company over alot of beers with a serving of second hand smoke from adjacent tables. Despite the second hand smoke, I had a great time chatting it up with my friends and making new friends on the patio.

I haven't been in a long time because the Bier Markt, while impressive for the world-array of beers, ales, and lagers, isn't anything to really travel your way out-of to go to.

Bier Markt is a new, clean ornate and sterile place. This space reminds me of the giant brew pubs you run into in the suburbs of Americana, except this one isn't surrounded by a huge parking lot just down the divided highway from the mall. Bier Markt does have a terrific selection of biers/beers from around the globe on tap, really good Belgiums, Germans, Framboise's, they even have Brooklyn (hoe!) Lager. The crowd at Bier Market is well dressed and good looking upper 20s into 30s. We weren't there for very long, but this place seemed like a pick-up bar. Our expedition did find that a breed similar to the American Cougar can indeed be found as far North as Toronto. Apparently, this species is more versatile than originally believed. Attempts to control the spread of this dangerous predator have not been successful. Beware or happy hunting! Although, more pretentious and with more attitude than other places we visited, patrons of Bier Markt were still friendly. There wasn't a cover when we got there, but when we left an hour later there was a line 40 deep waiting to get in. Live entertainment at Bier Markt at 9:00 on a Saturday consisted of a cover band. Prior to their set, the deejay was killing me spinning a set of 90s Top 40 that included that SWV song that sampled Michael Jackson's Human Nature and that cherry cherry cola song by Savage Garden. I'd never been so happy to see a cover band take the stage just to get that deejay away from his laptop. The mega-bar isn't really my type of place, but given how club-centric downtown Toronto is, this place wasn't that bad for the older crowd.

If you are looking for a fun experience and some really tasty food, I definitely recommend this place. We arrived around 6 PM on a Sunday evening. The restaurant was about 1/2 full. We were greeted and seated right away. My boyfriend and I had never attended before so our server explained the menu and process to us and took our drink order. The restaurant was tastefully decorated, everything was clean and tidy. They call the servers ""pirates"" which I think was playful and fun. The menus were very easy to understand, giving you a three step process of choosing your seafood. The seafood is seasonal, so some of the options may not always be available. They also have a chicken option if you don't like seafood. Then you choose your sauce and then your spice level. I ordered the lobster with garlic sauce and no spice. My boyfriend ordered the chicken with the captains boil sauce and our friend ordered snow crab legs with the captains boil sauce. She also ordered oysters, and my boyfriend and I got garlic bread. The seafood was to die for. The sauce was amazing. The lobster and crab were cooked perfectly. My boyfriends chicken was delicious. When you eat, you do not get a plate. The food comes in a bag with what sauce you ordered, you get a pair of plastic gloves, a bib and pair of nut crackers and you go to town. It was a really different experience. After you are finished, you throw all your left overs in a can on the table. There is a sink station in the middle of the restaurant where you can go wash your hands off if you got dirty, which you will. All in all, I had a very positive experience.

The Louisiana style dining does have a charm but it still isn't worth the price tag. I would expect to have some basics down, but $50 for crab is a bit pricey. All prices are based on lb. The lunch menu looked more appealing. Not to mention that no kids menu. For Dinner, however, suggest that you go next door to the Red Lobster for a better experience and food get rather than dress like a pirate (read plastic gloves and plastic bib) with an oversized garbage bin on your table.",images/stars-2.png

I definitely don't enjoy eating with flimsy little gloves on, while my piping hot food is in some crappy plastic bag leaking out all over the table. My experience would have much more enjoyable if they provided the option of a plate/bowl and cutlery. Even your leftovers have to be taken home in a sloppy bag, it's gross. This place is expensive and overrated, and the sauce leaves a bad aftertaste. As far as the menu goes, I'm not a fan of the extra costs associated with ordering sides, when the main protein is so darn expensive to begin with.

Right off the bat our server asked what we would like to order without considering if we have been here or not. I found that she was assuming we knew what we wanted without giving us the time to look over the menu or asking if we have any questions. Our server was very friendly and she meant well, though we knew english wasn't her first language so it was very difficult to understand her. Overall the seafood was fresh. All items on the menu had a lot of flavour and was cooked to perfection.

restaurants_list.html,The Farmer's House,http://mlg.ucd.ie/modules/yalp/reviews_7RUVYMpfc6_WbGYw6a_1Tw.html,positive,1,"I wonder how many people drive through Marda Loop, glance at the cute house on the corner of 33rd Ave and 21st St and continue on oblivious to the hidden gem of a restaurant enclosed in the trees. This is exactly what The Farmer's House is, a hidden gem in Calgary's Marda Loop. The house itself was built in 1912 and truly is a piece of history that still stands strong in Calgary's SW. I was lucky enough to hear about this spot through word of mouth online and was quick to add it to my lists of places to try after skimming some reviews and pictures. The Farmer's House as the name suggests used to be a farmer's house. The building has been refreshed, but they've kept the rustic and old fashioned feel intact and the home still feels cozy inside with tables nestled around an open kitchen. Outback they've actually parked a food truck that belongs to one of the restaurateurs; this now serves as an auxiliary kitchen. What really drew me to The Farmer's House is their beautiful patio; I've been on all kinds of patios but what really makes this patio special is it's immersed within the trees and fencing of the home. This ingenious idea translates to cozy and welcoming patio experience that feels like true country home dining. There's a good mix of sunny and shady spots, so whether you prefer to be right in the sun or lay low there's a spot for you. You'll be surprised how large it actually is; they could fit larger parties as well if need be as well. They also have some lights and heaters for night time, I bet this place would be great to hang out at on a warm summer evening, definitely adding that to the to do list for a future visit! You don't have to take my word for it though; they're actually set-up on Google so you can ""See inside"" the restaurant through photos on Google Maps, great to see a restaurant take advantage of this technology :). The food selection definitely fits the homey and country feel. They feature salads, flatbreads, sharing platters, sandwiches and an all day brunch menu. They also have a daily special board that I found quite large. All the prices were very fair. My fiancÃ©e went with a Spinach Salad w/ Chicken and I had the Daily Deli Sandwich which was a Calabrese Pork Loin Sandwich. I also ordered roasted potatoes and their homemade ketchup on the side. Their drink selection is on the smaller side, but features local choices which I found appropriate for the setting. The portion sizes are a great size, they're not overwhelming but still a big enough size that you can enjoy the meal and feel full. The salad was good with a modest sized piece of chicken, nothing too special but the Mustard Herb Vinaigrette was solid. The sandwich was served on a full baguette, but was a tad too toasted and crunchy. Looking past this the flavours was good though and it tasted wholesome. I was very impressed with the roasted potatoes and ketchup though, absolutely delicious. I'm not a ketchup person what so ever, but I used up all the ketchup on my plate, it's that good! One thing I found a bit deceiving and disappointing is that their sign says ""Kitchen & General Store"", naturally I assumed they sold food items, unfortunately I was let down and this was more aesthetic than anything. I actually asked the server if they sold the ketchup which I would've happily purchased lol :). Service was so-so overall, it took quite a while to get acknowledged and served when we first got there. Once we did put in our order there was quite a wait before our drinks were brought out and even longer before we were even given water. Definitely a bit disappointed on that end. We did learn that they were short staffed though and there was a large party in the back we couldn't see, so I was more understanding with this added insight. Towards the end our server was much more attentive when things slowed down and she was definitely able to redeem the bad first impression. I'll definitely give it another go, good overall experience first time around!",images/stars-4.png

Speaking of, the cappuccinos are delicious. I ordered the daily deli sandwich special and loved it. A full baguette loaded with cheese surrounded by Italian deli meats and a fair amount of spice. I wish I could remember just what the heck was in it but unfortunately it was high quality Italian things that I can't read or pronounce. Extra foodie points to you if you know all their deli ingredients! They accommodated my dining partner's dietary restrictions without any problems, offering Gluten Free options and even returning to the table to mention that the pesto contained a small amount of parmesan, when he asked to have his flatbread without mozza.

Based on the prior review I expected amazing flatbread...and since that is really the only thing on the menu besides cheese platters and chutney, you'd THINK they'd be phenomenal. First, it was quite surprised at how extremely limited the menu was. Flatbreads or cheese platter or melted cheese with chutney. We ordered the Chicken & Pesto and Sausage & Peppers flatbreads, and waited. And waited. We were told the wait was because 6 flatbreads were in at once. There were THREE tables of people. If flatbreads is all you do and three tables gets your kitchen backed up, that's concerning. Finally when the flatbreads came out, I was seriously disappointed. While the Sausage & Pepper WAS good, kudos on the pickled onion, the Chicken and Pesto was a huge sad face. I'm fairly certain the problem was WAY too much cheese, which overtook any of the other flavours, if there were any, although an edge piece with less cheese was still lacking flavour... As a lactose intolerant person I love cheese more than most (it is like a man you can't have that just makes you want him more!!) but this amount of cheese was overkill. And again, if ALL you offer is flatbread, you really should be an ace at them. I really want to support businesses in my community but I probably won't come back here. As for a place to bring KIDS? Ahahahahaa. Well, I GUESS if you're the type of person whose kid appreciates a good chutney....in which case...whoa.",images/stars-3.png

They are about a mile south of the 202. My Dad once lived in Ashland, OR years ago and I vaguely remember going through the original Human Bean drive-thru there. That's where this company got their start. They are known for their hand-crafted espresso drinks and fruit-infused smoothies. And of course every drink is topped with a white chocolate espresso bean. They have a program called the Farm Friendly Direct that allows them to work directly with the farming communities that harvest their beans so that they can build long-term relationships with them. This location has a double drive-thru or you can walk up to the window. You order directly from the barista and not through some intercom which I love.

Another lady then came up and was going to charge me for my cold brew drink. I asked her if I could just pay the difference because I was dissatisfied from my first drink, or if I could just get a refund and she made it so complicated. So I left with the drink I first paid for which was the wrong drink. STARBUCKS would have offered me a free drink. I should have went to Starbucks. *Replying to the owner* That barista did not offer a refund. She said ""because it is already in the system they can't refund us the money."" At that point my boyfriend and I told them never mind and drove away because they made it seem so complicated. This place is never getting our business again.

How have I lived without The Human Bean all these years? First off, there are two drive-thrus (***so no more 15 minute Starbucks lines!!!), and a walk up window as well! The staff was cheerful, patient, and very informative... This is key to me, especially in a coffee shop, and The Human Bean nailed it! I ordered a vanilla granita topped with whipped cream. A granita is basically a blended espresso drink and your choice of flavoring - lots to choose from! I would definitely recommend this drink if it's your first time visiting because the staff mentioned that it's a signature of theirs! If you're looking for something a little lighter, I ordered a latte (w/ almond milk and SF Irish cream flavoring) the second time I came, and it was delicious as well! My favorite part is the chocolate covered espresso bean they top all of their drinks with! It's such an adorable touch! I cannot wait to watch this gem grow, grow, & grow! I'll definitely be back soon because if you can't already tell, I'm obsessed! Thank you THB for a wonderful coffee experience!",images/stars-5.png

The Human Bean is the newest drive thru coffee shop in town, with its original ties to Oregon, it's bringing their coffee and steamers to us. They have your traditional offerings from lattes, to breves and some smoothies for the kids. The menu is simple with a few seasonal offerings. I ordered the Snowy Mocha which was perfection. The sweet was subtle and the coffee was perfectly smooth. I ordered Mate Latte for my husband hot and he loved the taste. The best part, each drink comes with a chocolate covered espresso bean! I have been watching their facebook for a while and the cool thing is this stand was a prefab that was just installed less than a month ago! The prices were good and the staff were extremely friendly. The stand has two sides to take your order so you don't have to wait long.

It's a small little shop where you can walk up to the window or drive through. They offer lots of different coffee products but I decided to go with their signature Granita with caramel and whip cream It is soooo good and refreshing and sweet and delicious. I also hear the java chip flavor is amazing so I'll have to try that one next time!! The staff was super friendly and the music they were playing was upbeat and fun.

I was gonna let it slide but my bf insisted on talking to them. So we called Jose(our server) over. He apologized and left with the plate for a new order. 2 mins later, his manager came over to apologize. He asked if we were okay to wait another 10-12 mins for new order because my bf had finished his food, or he could exchange it for something else. We said it's ok. 10 mins later, the manager personally bought the new plate to us. The food came out perfect, even my bf said it was good (he doesn't like steak).

We both had the bacon wrapped filet mignon w/ blue cheese and mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked to perfection and although I generally dont care for blue cheese all that much, this was outstanding bc they had creamed the cheese and paired it with 3-4 roasted garlic cloves which took the edge off and gave it a really rich and beautiful taste. The creme brulee was large enough for us to share and very very tasty. The pricing was a bit much. We had a $100 gift card, otherwise we would not have chosen this location.

Lightly fired should at least be slightly crispy. My hubby ordered the BBQ chicken and ribs. Both were VERY dry and had no flavor. The did come with two small containers of BBQ sauce, which came with a nice think gooey skin on top. I ordered the teriyaki sirloin, cooked medium, and shrimp.

I've never been to Tokyo, but if the eats are as good as Tokyo Stop in Tempe I must visit someday! Just today I enjoyed another delicious meal from here. I must say I am a big fan of Tokyo Stop every time without a glitch my plate is prepared to perfection. Tokyo Stop is a small restaurant with a big taste with very limited seating, therefor I usually always order carry-out. During lunch hours long lines can be expected, which is a good indicator that the food here is pleasantly tasteful. I usually almost always stop by during lunch hours and I can honestly say the ambience here during lunch is pretty calm even though many hungry lunch seekers love to patronize this restaurant. Customers can be seen waiting outside as they wait patiently for their order number to be called next. Inside siting is limited I believe I counted seven small tables some seating four others just for two. I almost always order a lunch box combo which consists of generous portion of spicy teriyaki chicken on a bed of savory brown rice and crispy crap puffs as my preferred choice of side, all this eats for just under nine-dollars. The chicken is soft and tender and to dry as its often made to order. The bed of brown rice they serve with this entrÃ©e is usually cooked perfectly, although the standard type of rice served alongside every plate is steamed white grain rice. Every large lunch box comes with two sides, I would recommend you guys try the savory crispy crab puffs made fresh to order every time. Dip them inside a sweet orange sauce that is house made, I know I asked! For those cautious eaters out there, I recommend the steamed vegetables which consist of squash, cabbage, and carrots. I must point out that the best part of ""Lunch Box E"" is the spicy teriyaki sauce, which is made from scratch. It has enough kick to it to satisfy any spice enthusiast, but sweet enough like a proper teriyaki glaze should be. I eat here at least twice a week, I really like how welcoming their customer service is here. every time I choose to patronize this restaurant I am greeted upon my entry. I believe this is a family operated business, with hired help cooking in the kitchen. Customer service here is great, when I call they always recognize my voice and know exactly how I want my order made ""sauce on the side and no chives"" every time! I orders are always fresh and handed over with a warm smile alongside a good amounts of condiments like mustard and soy sauce. Overall Tokyo Stop is a great spot to grab lunch on the go!

In this case, it was really ""ma ma""--""not so good"" in Nihongo (Japanese). As a matter of fact, I quit eating it after the second bite and ordered a tonkotsu ramen. This was definitely not a traditional katsudon. Instead of a sliced katsu, steeped in shoyu sauce base with cooked mixed egg and onion slices on top of rice, it was sort of chunks of katsu with sort of egg mixed in with large chopped pieces of onion sort of mixed in with rice--and no shoyu-based sauce. Very dry. Not appetizing. And the katsu was over-cooked and somewhat tough. I would give this katsudon only 1.5 stars. The ramen was better. Decent broth, decent ingredients. However, there was way too much bean sprouts in it which totally got in the way of enjoying the noodles. I really didn't like it being served in a paper cup/bowl, either. I would give the ramen 3 stars. I had a bite of my wife's yakisoba. It was OK, not great. Maybe 2.5 or 3 stars. Service was very friendly. I do not think he is Nihonjin, though or else he really does not know the language because the little Japanese I spoke to him in Japanese tradition, he kind of mumbles something inaudible back.",images/stars-2.png

Sadly, the ramen was on par with dorm room cooking and should be avoided. The noodles were actually not half bad, it was everything else that let it down. And what was up with dining in out of a paper soup bowl? The pork slices were dry and bland. Not even a good soak in the just salty broth could wake it up. Interestingly half of the bowl was filled with bean sprouts. In itself that's not a problem, but it meant that it took up room that could have been occupied by some other treats. Not a ramen stop by any means. Of note, it's next to a Japanese grocery store and a Japanese bakery.",images/stars-2.png

However, the chicken looked and tasted like it was fried yesterday and the fried rice had no semblance of ""crispy""ness that you want from fried rice. The rice looked like white rice with a little soy sauce on it and had absolutely no flavor. Customary fried rice ingredients include eggs, carrots and other veggies, but this had one small bite of carrot pieces and nothing else to keep me from diving in. No seasoning, no flavor. The chicken, which was dark meat, had an overly chewy texture compared to ordinary dark meat. The fry on the chicken, as I alluded to earlier, was old, disgusting and left an unfortunate taste in my mouth. Worst of all, it felt ""heavy"" and it still is sitting in my stomach.

Second, it's obvious that the teriyaki sauce was just poured over the vegetables, which made me a little sad. I definitely prefer to have my sauce and veggies cooked together, so the veggies pick up some of the flavors. Not to mention, the flavor of the teriyaki sauce was a little bland. The veggies were cooked very well, although I would have liked some tofu or water chestnuts/bamboo shoots, or sesame seeds in with my veggies. The only veggies that came with the dis were cabbage, broccoli, and carrots; no onion, no garlic, no flavor. The crab puffs were basically crab rangoon, only all the good stuff and not too much cream cheese.

Squirt a pool of The Rooster in a corner of the container on your way out . . . ahhh, yeah The hot & spicy anything is good, and for those trying to cut the carbs, the chicken teriyaki salad is a must. Delicious and light. And they automatically put the teriyaki sauce on the side, which is nice, giving you the choice to drench or drizzle The prices are great for the huge portions you get. I learned quickly that you're not just ordering lunch, you're also ordering leftovers. I've never once finished an entree in one sitting. The only negatives . . . I haven't really been impressed with any of the sides, and the sushi is beyond blah. The seating area is tiny, but I've never gone there to sit and eat, so no biggie to me.

So basically, Tokyo Stop is a ""fast food"" asian place that delivers HUGE. If you are starving, this is the place to go. I'm serious. You know those mexican places that serve up burritos that keep you full for the entire day? Same concept, different genre of food. So far, I've had 4 meals there, the Sweet and Sour Chicken, The Orange Chicken, the Hot and Spicy Chicken, and the House Chili Chicken, and I'm only going to review the first 3, because the House Chile and the Hot and Spicy were the exact same thing. With the Sweet & Sour/Orange chicken, the restaurant suffers slightly. I attribute that to the fact that the super deep fried pieces of chicken are completely soaked in sauce. For the Sweet & Sour, the addition of Sriracha helped add the ""sour"" to the sauce, but for the Orange...well lets just say I've had my fill of Orange Marmalade for a year. The Hot & Spicy is really where this place shines. The chicken is perfectly cooked( lightly fried in chili oil) and topped off with vegetables and chilis. Goes great with the tableside spicy rice seasoning. And now, the price. For about 6 bucks, you get a huge meal, and wonderful service. My only issue with place (minus the sauce) is the lack of room, but Dunkin Donuts is right down the way, and they have outside tables. It isn't perfect, but it's tasty and fast.

Every aspect of my experience was atrocious. The server was pleasant but it didnt take long for the night to get off to a bad start. I went for dinner with 3 other people and out came 3 starters but one soup was nowhere to be seen. The server came over to the table numerous times and didnt notice the fact that he had no food in front of him. About 30 minutes passed and out came his main course. At which point he enquired about his missing starter. The server came back and apologised and said that the manager agreed to take a startling $3 off the bill to adequately compensate him. Obviously,we found the $3 gesture a derisory offer but we just werent in the mood to complain and said we would just leave it at that and not make a fuss. From this point onwards there was a plethora of mistakes,one after another. The food itself was poor. We ordered a steak, a pasta dish,a pad thai dish and a teriyaki dish. 4 completely different types of cuisine but they had one thing in common: they tasted awful! The service was very slow and pieces of food came in dribs and drabs, with long wait times in between. One friend of mine,ordered a cappucino and it came old cold.Another ordered cheesecake which against all odds,actually tasted delicious. Completely fed up we decided to just get out of there as quick as possible and to cap everything else off the Credit machine wasnt working!! We were told to sit down and wait for 5 minutes while the machine recharged. At this point we requested to speak to a manager. The server kept making excuses,saying that they were so busy due to TIFF being on and that they usually get great compliments from customers. Firstly,the restaurant was moderately busy but far from hectic. Certainly not enough to justify all the failures on display. And secondly,how does someone else complimenting their dinner help my bad experience? Throughout the night the servers were constantly citing excuses to other customers to explain their shortcomings. It seemed as if complaints meant nothing to them and they were accustomed to excuses. Ive worked in the service industry in the past and would be mortfied if such complaints were directed towards me. Their ambivalence to the complaints was truly shocking and unacceptable. The server re-emerged to say that the manager was too busy to come speak to us and that he would only say the same things that she was saying. Again, this is unacceptable. What sort of respectable manager has no interest in speaking with disgruntled customers? I decided to seek the manager myself. When I asked for the manager I was again told he was ""too busy"" to deal with us. At this point there was an astronomincal 10-15 people in the restaurant,so I understood that he would be unavailable. I enquired as to where the manager was and was told that he actually wasnt there. So we were lied to by multiple employees. The gentleman I spoke to said that the floor manager wasnt there and he was the bar manager, so by virtue of that fact, he was the manager on duty. I believe his name was Min and without a shadow of doubt,he is the most unprofessional, inept manager Ive ever encountered. I explained my frustration and he actually began laughing in my face!! I questioned what was so funny and he just kept saying ""Im so sorry."" Its hard to see sincerity in someones apology when he is on the cusp of full blown laughter. With the restaurant under his command its no surprise how much of a shambles it is. He hadnt even got the professional courtesy to even listen to our concerns. I asked him if he felt a $3 discount was an appropriate solution to a completely spoiled evening where the bill was $151. He continued to laugh and frivolously apologise and offered so explanation. All in all a terrible experience. Awful food Awful service Inexplicable management Theres a hotdog stand on the corner of the street which would offer a more enjoyable and engaging dining experience than The ""Ultimate"" Cafe. The only reason I have given this restaurant 1 star is because Yelp doesnt allow you give 0 stars,which is a far fairer reflection of this restaurant.",images/stars-1.png

I ordered the Stead and Eggs. The food was reasonably good. They served my steak medium - as I ordered it. Buttered toast was crispy and not dry. Potatoes were seasoned properly. Presentation was okay, if a bit understated. Portion size was just right. The only thing that bothered me about the order was that they put what I think was steak sauce on the steak. I don't use steak sauce. Having the kitchen put it there makes it seem they're not confident in their steak. The food took a while to be served. Considering that we were the first group to come in at that time, it still took about 20 minutes for the first plate to be served. On the other hand, the ambiance of the place was better than average. The lighting and decor gives it a pub atmosphere. I find it comfortable personally. Overall, Ultimate Cafe is so-so. Food is good, but nothing to write home about. Probably not a good place to go if you're in a hurry. Perhaps it should be called the Easy Going Cafe. P.S.

The service, however was sub-par, but I did notice a Hiring Now sign in the window. Overall, I can't complain; lunch was cheap and my stomach was satisfied. It's nothing special. We've probably all been to a place like this in Toronto; just another restaurant, nothing more.",images/stars-3.png

We were feeling Italian-ish and not wanting to spend more than $20 per person. Ultimate Cafe's menu looked ok to my lunch buddy so we walked in. In all honesty, we should've walked away. Upon seating, our server gave us a view of her cleavage and asked us for our drink orders with nary a smile. No smile. A few minutes later, she slammed our water glasses down on the table. Shannon decided on a Chicken with Rose Sauce pasta and a side Caesar salad. I ordered Italian sausage with Tomato Sauce pasta. No smile. She comes back with a basket of stale bread and packets of rock hard butter. Then our food came. Shannon said her pasta was ok . But her Caesar salad was disgusting with its bottled dressing, wilted lettuce, clumps of powdered parmesan and 2 stale croutons. My pasta was also disgusting. The italian sausage was the same sausage sold at hot dog stands. If I wanted street meat, I would've bought it from the vendor. The tomato sauce was nothing special like it came out of a bottle. It seems ready-made convenience food was popular with Ultimate Cafe. Did they actually make anything or was everything just opened up, heated up and plated? Cold and apathetic service + BAD food = Never ever going there again.",images/stars-1.png

I've been here once before and was not at all impressed so I wasn't expecting too much. Well, it was even worse than the first time! My son, being a kid, opted for a slice of cheese pizza which was still in the oven so at least that was fresh. I opted for some spaghetti. I watched the server put some noodles into a black plastic bowl and top it off with sauce. I looked away for a second and the bowl was no longer on the counter. We stood there for a couple minutes, looking at the server and others behind the counter for some sort of a cue to see if we should stay there or move toward the register or something. The next thing I see is our server kneel down and pull my spaghetti out of the abyss. I asked if she had just pulled it out of a microwave and she said yes. I told her I didn't want it then to which she replied ""well, we microwave all of our food"". I guess that explains part of the reason why it tastes so bad! I think almost everyone knows that you DON'T microwave anything in a plastic dish that isn't meant to go in the microwave! Even the ones that are meant to go in the microwave are questionable. If my kid wouldn't have REALLY wanted pizza we wouldn't have bothered to purchase anything from them.

""We only have bottled water"" I was told. Nice scambo guys. It backfired here this time though. I left the slice that the cook prepared for me there and found another place to spend my money. Out of principle, I think I'd stay away from these goofs. They don't deserve your hard earned money. To further end, I think its the law in Arizona that an establishment must give you a glass of water when asked even if you're not buying anything. That's part of owning a restaurant in the desert...especially in July. The manager who instructed employees to do this should be fired. No questions asked, do not pass go, do not collect $200. And the young girl with braces who shared this policy with me in such a smug and irreverent manner should be let go too until she learns to question the integrity of a directive. Would she also ""short change a customer"" if she'd been instructed to? Would she do it with the same arrogant demeanor and panache? I worry that she might. She didn't flinch when I took my business elsewhere. She knew beyond question that she was far better than me. And I shutter to think of the message it sends. They don't have tap water back there? How the heck do they wash all of the equipment and utensils when making the food they are serving. Obviously they didn't think through that response too well??? Look at the bad P.R. you just received for thinking its clever to refuse a paying customer a cup of water in hopes of getting them to pay $2.49 for a .20 cent bottle. I'd be willing to bet that either you'll have changed this ludicrous policy by the next time I stop next door to get barbecue, tacos or a pretzel OR you'll be closing up shop shortly thereafter. You guys don't deserve to have my business. Nor anybody I can share this story with.",images/stars-1.png

I went in on a Wednesday, hours 4p-9p. Now granted I showed up at 8:05p but there was only two other tables occupied. Immediately, I mean within 5 seconds of walking in the door, I was greeted with, ""Do you know we close at 9."" For a second I thought well apparently they clearly do not want my business this late at night. The only reason I stayed was to utilize a Living Social voucher I purchased. So myself and my date ordered drinks and while we enjoyed the complimentary stale bread, the person the greeted us so very nice at the door, continued to stare at us until I mentioned something to her. The entire time I was rushed by the thought that if I didn't get out by 9p, I would feel the wrath of the person that greeted us. The entrÃ©e was brought to us before we were finished with our house salads and boxes were offered before our forks were down. While paying for bill I thought, shit, I better chug this beer before I get booted. Good food, nice bar area, aweful dÃ©cor, aweful service if you go ""in too late"".

Second time, we go...instead of replacing our meal, we get handed 2 boxes (supposedly entrees)...we bring them home, pop open, oh my god! Missing beans, and sides!! Even entree is not complete!

The hostess seemed very flustered the whole time she was trying to give our menus and actually seemed annoyed when telling us about the drink specials of the night. (We overheard her telling a different table about drinks that she never did mention to us...) The waitress came and she was pleasant enough and brought our drinks reasonably quick. I ordered the chicken parmesan and my BFF ordered tilapia. Both came out looking very good. Both tasted very good. No complaints on the taste of the food but it was nothing outstanding, either. I felt like I could have been at any Italian restaurant anywhere. When our food arrived our waitress asked if anyone wanted fresh grated parmesan and I said yes. Ten minutes later, she finally came back with the cheese. While she apologized profusely for it, I was 75% done with my food by that time.

I could've easily shared one meal with my girl and I'm not exactly a light eater. I'm picky about how things look, i found the tile floor and plain drop ceiling boring. If they were going for a small, kinda cozy italian restaurant, they missed the mark. The bar and kitchen (open kitchen behind the bar) area looked clean, everything else was alright. So, the bill issue... We both asked for alla vodka sauce and the server had told someone at the opposite side of our table that there was a small upcharge for switching from marinara to alfredo. My girl and I didn't hear that and proceeded to switch ours from marinara to alla vodka. She didn't tell us about the upcharge. Normally, I'd expect 1, maybe 2 bucks (and to be told that there's an upcharge) and I'm over it. It was $4 EACH. This made a great meal end with annoyance. She took one off and it ended up 2 each, it was fine at the end, but I didn't think I should've had to tell them how insane a $4 upcharge for a ladle full of sauce was.

Once seated our server was pretty attentive. One friend ordered a Blue Moon and he told us there was only one more left so he was holding it for him. While I felt it was pathetic they didn't have more in stock given that it was 7pm on a Friday, I appreciated his honesty. One friend had the tilapia which he enjoyed. I had the gnocchi rossa which was very tasty. Our other friend had the salmon salad which the menu listed as having arugula but she said it was just a spring mix but still good.
