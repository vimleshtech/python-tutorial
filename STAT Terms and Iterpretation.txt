coefficient
----------------
a numerical or constant quantity placed before and multiplying the variable in an algebraic expression


Mean squared error
-------------------------
In statistics, the mean squared error (MSE) or mean squared deviation (MSD) of an estimator (of a procedure for estimating an unobserved quantity) measures the average of the squares of the errors or deviations—that is, the difference between the estimator and what is estimated

Variance score 
---------------------------
In statistics, the score, score function, efficient score or informant indicates how sensitive a likelihood function L


R-squared
-------------
R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression. ... 100% indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around its mean.


Adjusted R-Square
---------------------
Adjusted R Squared interpretation
The adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that has been adjusted for the number of predictors in the model. The adjusted R-squared increases only if the new term improves the model more than would be expected by chance. It decreases when a predictor improves the model by less than expected by chance.

Intercept 
--------------------
In the equation of a straight line (when the equation is written as "y = mx + b"), the slope is the number "m" that is multiplied on the x, and "b" is the y-intercept (that is, the point where the line crosses the vertical y-axis).


p value
----------------
When you perform a hypothesis test in statistics, a p-value helps you determine the significance of your results. ... The p-value is a number between 0 and 1 and interpreted in the following way: A small p-value (typically = 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis
